Hmm, indeed, so the namespace FDs point internally to the internal
proc mount that is created during pidns initialization, this means
NS_GET_PARENT ioctl won't change which is good, only things that
relate on stat()ing other inodes may notice.

Sounds good, from the devpts history it seems that "newinstance" was
used to absorb new changes/updates easily, and it was made a no-op
only recently with commit eedf265aa003b4 "devpts: Make each mount of
devpts an independent filesystem."  last year, where the initial
introduction was via commit 2a1b2dc0c83bbfc24 "Enable multiple
instances of devpts"  in 2009

Starting from this: 1) "hidepid" works withe the "gid" membership
option which is sticky, I would like to avoid this combination, plus
2) "hidepid" now changes the pid namespace option.

With "newinstance" set:

* "hidepid" instead of changing the pid namespace options, it will
only affect the new procfs instance.

* Changing "hidepid" value during a remount of a *private* procfs
instance will only affect that procfs instance and not the pid
namespace or the other shared procfs mounts.

* "pids=ptraceable" makes /proc/ show only pids that the caller can
ptrace. Together with NO_NEW_PRIVS set, it makes a good privacy
measure.
"pids=ptraceable" is also for *LSM* so we guarantee that there is a
ptrace security hook there for LSMs and that there are no relations or
exceptions between "pids=ptraceable" and "hidepid" / "gid" mount
options. This will benefit Yama LSM later.

* "pids=ptraceable" will take precedence over "hidepid"


I assume defaulting later to new instances should continue to work, comments ?


Thanks!
