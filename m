Above line is pointless you overwrite value right below

Same as above

Is page->private use for vmalloc memory ? If so then pick another field.
Thought i doubt it is use i would need to check. What was the exact
objection made ?

As you can see this is an union and thus the meaning of that field depends
on how the page is use. The private comment you see is only meaningfull for
page that are in the page cache and are coming from a file system ie when
a process does an mmap of a file. When page is use by sl[au]b the slab_cache
field is how it is interpreted ... Context in which a page is use do matter.

Here we are talking about memory that is allocated to back vmalloc area so
the private field is unuse AFAICR and it is safe to use it while the page
is use for vmalloc.

Note that i don't think anyone is doing vmap() of pages that are in the page
cache that would seem wrong from my point of view but maybe some one is.
Thought someone might be doing vmap() of pages in which the private field is
use for something (like a device driver private field) in which case you might
still have false positive. You might want to simply add something either to
vm_struct or vmap_area to know if a range of vmalloc area has been created
by pmalloc or not. Maybe you don't even need to tag page and storing flag
in vmap_area or vm_struct would be enough.
