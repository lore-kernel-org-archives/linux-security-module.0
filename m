Because, as Matthew Wilcox pointed out [1] (well, that's how I
understood it) de-referencing a NULL pointer will cause the kernel to
complain loudly.

Where is the NULL pointer coming from?

a) from a bug in the user of the API - in that case it will be noticed,
reported and fixed, that is how also other in-kernel APIs work

b) from an attacker - it will still trigger an error from the kernel,
but it cannot really do much else, besides crashing repeatedly and
causing a DOS. However, there are so many other places that could be
under similar attack, that it doesn't seem to make a difference having a
check here only.

If the value was coming from userspace, that would be a completely
different case and some sort of sanitation would be mandatory.
