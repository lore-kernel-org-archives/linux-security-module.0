'status' field ? I don't see it in the current patch set.
You mean something like scratch space in landlock_ctx that
program can write to? Sure, that's a good extension.

sure. there will be future extensions. I still fail to see
why 'abi' field is needed.
Also consider that bpf core itself is being extended all the time as well.
The verifier gets smarter and smarter, so the programs deemed unsafe
a year ago now recognized properly by the verifier.
New instructions being added to the core and so on.
That means that newer landlock programs will not be acceptable by
older kernels. We cannot increment abi/version with every such change.
It's also possible that in the future we may catch a security bug
in the verifier that will start rejecting some corner case of the programs.
The only way to use landlock is to develop a set of programs/rules
for kernel version X and we together will guarantee that these programs
will work fine in the future kernels.
There is a good chance that the rules developed for kernel X+1 will _not_
be loadable on older kernel X even if you don't change anything on
landlock side (helpers, actions, events), so landlock abi/version will
stay the same but you won't get the effect you're looking to get from
this abi concept. Since landlock abi=1 in kernel X and abi=1 in kernel X+1
doesn't mean that landlock rules developed for X+1 will work on X.
Beyond bpf core there are other moving pieces. LSM may get new hooks,
seccomp side will be changed, etc. Incrementing landlock abi is not pracitcal.
