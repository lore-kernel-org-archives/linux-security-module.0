I understand your concern about relying on initcall ordering.

However, I think there is an important difference in scope in this case.
This change primarily affects the IMA subsystem, and the impact is
largely confined to IMA (at least based on my current understanding).

Also, this is not just about FF-A. The issue arises when TPM devices are
deferred, and IMA does not handle such cases properly. From that
perspective, moving ima_init() to a later stage is not simply about
adjusting ordering, but about ensuring that IMA correctly handles its
dependency on TPM devices.

In other words, the goal here is not to align dependencies indirectly
via initcall levels, but to ensure that IMA is initialized only after
its required dependencies are ready.

Regarding pKVM, finalise_pkvm() runs at the device_initcall_sync level.
Because of this, the FF-A driver needs a reliable way to determine when
pKVM initialization has completed, rather than relying purely on
initcall ordering.
