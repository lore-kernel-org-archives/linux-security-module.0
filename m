I haven't put a PEM stripper and base64 decoder into the kernel, though we
certainly could do that.  We could even do the decode in-place in the same
buffer since the resulting data would be smaller than the original.

It passes it to each parser in turn till one says it can parse it.  It's not
ideal, but it seems to work - so far.  Better would be to annotate it in some
way.  I have considered annotating the type field so that the payload doesn't
have to have it added:

	keyctl padd asymmetric.x509 "" @s </tmp/foo.x509
	keyctl padd asymmetric.pkcs#8 ...
	keyctl padd asymmetric.tpm ...

However, this doesn't work with "keyctl update" or "keyctl instantiate".
