Josh Boyer's "MODSIGN: Allow the "db" UEFI variable to be suppressed"
patch checks MokIgnoreDB variable to ignore db:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dhowells/linux-fs.git/commit/?h=keys-uefi&id=7c395b30a33a617c5cc2cdd419300af71277b79a

I think that we can consider to use MokAllowDB. Which means that kernel
ignores DB by default.

As I remember that some manufacturers uses certificate in db to
sign their kernel module. We need to discuss with them for switching
to mok. Currently I do not know all use cases for using db.

There have some benefits for using db:

 - User does not need to deal with shim-mokmanager to enroll mok.
   Target machine doesn't need to reboot and user doesn't need to
   face to mokmanager UI.  

 - The db is a authenticated variable, it's still secure when secure
   boot is disabled.
   The db is a authenticated variable that it can only be modified
   by manufacturer's key. Kernel can trust it when secure boot
   is disabled. It's useful for we do not need to taint kernel
   for loading a manufacturer's kernel module even secure boot is
   disabled.

 - Do not need to worry about the space of NVRAM and the EFI firmware
   implementation for writing a boot time variable.
  
But I also agree that we should not trust all keys (like Microsoft key)
in db by default.

Thanks a lot!
