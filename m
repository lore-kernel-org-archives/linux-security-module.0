Your proposal is basically a pre-approved "batched" measurement, of a
set of known good measurements, without the corresponding list of
measurements that this "batched" measurement represents. ?Right?

This pre-approved "batched" measurement represents not what has been
accessed/executed on the system, but what potentially could be
accessed/executed. ?That's a major difference.

Huh? ?Patch "ima: don't report measurements if digests are included in
the loaded lists" is already doing this.

True, so you would be able to configure the system with one or the
other type of list, not both. ?At least there would be a clear
understanding of what that list represents.

Agreed, there is still room for more TPM improvements. ?Just Nayna's
one patch, without any other changes, brought the timing down from 53s
for a 1000 extends to just 11s. ?(The initial patch was Nack'ed, but
we're working with the tpmdd and the TCG's device driver work group
(DDWG).)

Right, there's always a trade off. ?My suggestion, assuming we go with
this approach, would be to make that trade off clear by using
different lists.

Currently, a measurement is added to the measurement list and then is
used to extend the TPM, before returning to the caller.

A performance improvement would still first add the measurement to the
measurement list, but would then queue and wait for the measurement to
extend the TPM, before returning to the caller. ?In a multi threaded
environment, the queued measurements could be "batched" - a hash of a
set of hashes - to extend the TPM.

The delay would be at most two times it takes to extend the TPM - one
to complete an existing current "batched" extend and another new
"batched" extend.

The difficulty with this approach is identifying which measurements
are included in which "batched" measurement. ?This approach provides
the same guarantees as previously.

Before making the TPM performance problem an IMA issue and "fixing" it
in IMA, I would prefer that the TPM performance be addressed directly.
