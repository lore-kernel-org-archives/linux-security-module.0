We cannot just keep on expanding CAP_SYS_ADMIN either.

Kees I like but you have forgot the all important rule.   The Linus
Rule.    Existing applications must  have a method work.
  So modify applications  binary is not way out of problem.

Please note making CAP_SYS_ADMIN the only way to use TIOCSTI also
means setting CAP_SYS_ADMIN on all the existing applications to obey
the Linus Rule of not break userspace.   So this is why the patch is
strictly no as this means elevating privilege of existing applications
and possibly opening up more security flaws.

Reality any patch like the one we are talking about due to the Linus
Rule and the security risk it will open up obey this it just be
rejected.   There is another kind of way I will cover with Serge.
