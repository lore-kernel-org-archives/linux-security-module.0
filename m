Actually, having thought about it some more, I think your way is better.

Yeah.  With hindsight, I think that firstly, joinable keyrings really need
enablement and, secondly, thread, process, session, user and user-session need
to have to be non-manually-creatable.

However, I'm not sure they can be renamed, since they're searchable and
joinable by name and fixing this might break something in userspace (though I
should hope that this is unlikely).

'.' wasn't a reserved char originally.
