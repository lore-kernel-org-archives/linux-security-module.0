Subject: [PATCH 2/7] FS-Cache: fix dereference of NULL user_key_payload
In-Reply-To: <20170928212602.41744-1-ebiggers3@gmail.com>

From: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>

When the file /proc/fs/fscache/objects (available with
CONFIG_FSCACHE_OBJECT_LIST=y) is opened, we request a user key with
description "fscache:objlist", then access its payload.  However, a
revoked key has a NULL payload, and we failed to check for this.
request_key() *does* skip revoked keys, but there is still a window
where the key can be revoked before we access its payload.

Fix it by checking for a NULL payload, treating it like a key which was
already revoked at the time it was requested.

Fixes: 4fbf4291aa15 ("FS-Cache: Allow the current state of all objects to be dumped")
