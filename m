1) Secure Boot is intended to permit the construction of a boot chain that
only runs ring 0 code that the user considers trustworthy
2) Allowing arbitrary user code to run in ring 0 without affirmative
consent on the part of the user is therefore incompatible with the goals of
Secure Boot
3) This patchset provides a mechanism to alter the behaviour of the kernel
such that it is significantly more difficult for arbitrary user code to run
in ring 0 without affirmative user consent
4) Providing a mechanism for automatically enabling this behaviour when
running in a context that is intended to restrict access to ring 0 is a
rational thing to do, because otherwise it is difficult to achieve the
objective in (1)

Alternative approaches to achieve (1) rely on severely constraining
userland - ChromeOS, for instance, doesn't impose these restrictions at
present but also doesn't allow users to run arbitrary applications (you're
stuck inside either the Chrome or Android sandbox). So, if the goal is to
achieve (1) when the platform is in this state, what's a more reasonable
alternative?
