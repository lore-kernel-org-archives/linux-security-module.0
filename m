It allows someone to give everyone access to files that should perhaps only be
accessible by root.  Besides, if you disable lockdown then you can do this if
you want.

Whilst that is a laudable idea, there are at least a couple of thousand files
to analyse, some of them doing weird stuff in drivers that aren't easy to
understand, and some of them with lists of files, some of which might be safe
and some of which aren't safe.  Even some reads that look like they ought to
be safe have side effects (such as read-and-reset counters).

Besides, define 'safe'.  Is reading a particular reg on a device and returning
the value through a debugfs read safe, for example?  What about files where
reading is harmless, but writing needs to be disallowed?

I did try initially passing in a flag to say whether something was safe or
not, abusing an inode flag to store it since debugfs uses a plain inode
struct, but then I realised just how many ways there are to create debugfs
files and it started to get out of hand.  My initial idea also included
locking everything down by default and marking things unlocked on an as-needed
basis.

If you have the time to audit all these files, then that would be great.

I lean more towards the lock debugfs down entirely side.
