You are not going to help anyone with a kernel configuration that
breaks agetty, csh, xemacs and tcsh. The opportunities for using
such a configuration are limited.

I'll bet you a beverage that 99-44/100% of the people who have
this enabled have no clue that it's even there. And if they did,
most of them would turn it off.

A security clamp-down that breaks important stuff is going
to have a tough row to hoe going upstream. Same with a performance
enhancement that breaks things.

Sure, but they have to work right. That's an important reason to do
small changes. A change that isn't acceptable can be rejected without
slowing the general progress.

Well, until someone comes along with yet another spiffy feature
like containers and breaks it again. This is why a really good
solution is required, and the one proposed isn't up to snuff.

They often are, but let's face it, not everyone has the time,
desire and/or expertise to solve every problem that comes up.

The impact of a "security measure" can exceed the value provided.
That is, I understand, the basis of the NAK. We need to be careful
to keep in mind that, until such time as there is substantial interest
in the sort of systemic changes that truly remove this class of issue,
we're going to have to justify the risk/reward trade off when we try
to introduce a change.
