Always follow the proper kernel coding style rules, as I don't want to
have someone else have to come along and fix up the error you have added
here :(

checkpatch.pl is your friend, really...

And why not do a warning with the device that caused the problem to
happen?  dev_warn has a ratelimit I think right?  "raw" printk messages
like this don't help in trying to track down what/who caused the issue.

And finally, can userspace see the namespace for the tty?  Doesn't
things like checkpoint/restore need that in order to properly set the
tty connection back up when moving processes?

v7?  :)

thanks,
