ok, I'll state it more clearly that it's enforced

yes, also for all the other ones

yes, it's a way to:
- preemptively beef up the pool, before entering atomic context
(unlikely that it will be needed, but possible), so that there is no
need to allocate extra pages (assuming one can estimate the max memory
that will be requested)
- avoid fragmentation caused by allocating smaller groups of pages


I'll add explanation for this.

Nothing special, it gets rounded up to the nearest multiple of
PAGE_SIZE. vmalloc doesn't have only drawbacks ;-)

yes, good point, I'm fixing it everywhere in the patchset
