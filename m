qcom_mdt_load() is passed a struct firmware object, which "data" is
passed into qcom_scm_pas_init_image(), which uses dma_alloc_coherent()
to allocate scratch memory to perform a call into secure world. So the
dma_alloc_coherent() here has nothing to do with firmware loading.

qcom_mdt_load() will then use request_firmware_into_buf() to load other
files into the passed void *mem_region, which either comes from a
memremap() or dma_alloc_coherent() call.

It does allocate memory.

I would expect that it's possible to read the content of the buffer from
a secondary execution context before the request_firmware_into_buf() has
verified the content of the buffer, but I would be considered a
seriously broken driver.
