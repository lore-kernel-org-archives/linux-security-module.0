Perhaps "phase (2)" would be a better name than "step (2)".  During (2),
multiple argument-supplying calls may be made.

Moving to phase (3) terminates phase (2).  This is triggered by userspace
writing "x create" or "x reconfigure" to the fd as things stand.

That got taken out and made general - which Linus then objected to.  I need to
reinsert this and make it fscontext-specific as most people would really like
to have it, the mount process being able to produce so many weird and
wonderful errors.

How about "... The filesystem should wrap the struct in one of its own, e.g."?

How about:

	An active LSM may return 0 to pass the option on to the filesystem, 1
	to cause the option to be discarded or an error to cause the option to
	be rejected.
