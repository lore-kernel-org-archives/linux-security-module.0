IMA-appraisal returns -EACCES for any error, including lack of xattr
support.

Thiago Bauermann posted the "Appended signatures support for IMA
appraisal" patch set. ?This patch set allows the current kernel module
appended signature format to be used for verifying the kernel image.
?Once that patch set is upstreamed, we'll be able to update the IMA
"secure_boot" policy to permit appended signatures.
