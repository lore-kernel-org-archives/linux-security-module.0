Subject: [PATCH v2 1/1]  Add Trusted Path Execution as a stackable LSM
In-Reply-To: <20170608034349.31876-1-matt@nmatt.com>
References: <20170608034349.31876-1-matt@nmatt.com>
Message-ID: <20170608034349.31876-2-matt@nmatt.com>
To: linux-security-module@vger.kernel.org
List-Id: linux-security-module.vger.kernel.org

This patch was modified from Brad Spengler's Trusted Path Execution (TPE)
feature. It also adds features and config options that were found in Corey
Henderson's tpe-lkm project.

Modifications from Brad Spengler's implementation of TPE were made to
turn it into a stackable LSM using the existing LSM hook bprm_set_creds.
Also, a new denial logging function was used to simplify printing messages
to the kernel log. Additionally, mmap and mprotect restrictions were
taken from Corey Henderson's tpe-lkm project and implemented using the
LSM hooks mmap_file and file_mprotect.

Trusted Path Execution is not a new idea:

http://phrack.org/issues/52/6.html#article

| A trusted path is one that is inside a root owned directory that
| is not group or world writable.  /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin, are
| (under normal circumstances) considered trusted.  Any non-root
| users home directory is not trusted, nor is /tmp.

To be clear, Trusted Path Execution is no replacement for a MAC system
like SELinux, SMACK, or AppArmor. This LSM is designed to be good enough
without requiring a userland utility to configure policies. The fact
that TPE only requires the user to turn on a few sysctl options lowers
the barrier to implementing a security framework substantially.

Threat Models:

1. Attacker on system executing exploit on system vulnerability

*  If attacker uses a binary as a part of their system exploit, TPE can
   frustrate their efforts

*  This protection can be more effective when an attacker does not yet
   have an interactive shell on a system

*  Issues:
   *  Can be bypassed by interpreted languages such as python. You can run
      malicious code by doing: python -c 'evil code'

2. Attacker on system replaces binary used by a privileged user with a
   malicious one

*  This situation arises when the administrator of a system leaves a
   binary as world writable.

*  TPE is very effective against this threat model

This Trusted Path Execution implementation introduces the following
Kconfig options and sysctls. The Kconfig text and sysctl options are
taken heavily from Brad Spengler's implementation. Some extra sysctl
options were taken from Corey Henderson's implementation.

CONFIG_SECURITY_TPE (sysctl=kernel.tpe.enabled)

default: n

This option enables Trusted Path Execution. TPE blocks *untrusted*
users from executing files that meet the following conditions:

* file is not in a root-owned directory
* file is writable by a user other than root

NOTE: By default root is not restricted by TPE.

CONFIG_SECURITY_TPE_GID (sysctl=kernel.tpe.gid)

default: 0

This option defines a group id that, by default, is the trusted group.
If a user is not trusted then it has the checks described in
CONFIG_SECURITY_TPE applied. Otherwise, the user is trusted and the
checks are not applied. You can disable the trusted gid option by
setting it to 0. This makes all non-root users untrusted.

CONFIG_SECURITY_TPE_STRICT (sysctl=kernel.tpe.strict)

default: n

This option applies another set of restrictions to all non-root users
even if they are trusted. This only allows execution under the
following conditions:

* file is in a directory owned by the user that is not group or
  world-writable
* file is in a directory owned by root and writable only by root

CONFIG_SECURITY_TPE_RESTRICT_ROOT (sysctl=kernel.tpe.restrict_root)

default: n

This option applies all enabled TPE restrictions to root.

CONFIG_SECURITY_TPE_INVERT_GID (sysctl=kernel.tpe.invert_gid)

default: n

This option reverses the trust logic of the gid option and makes
kernel.tpe.gid into the untrusted group. This means that all other groups
become trusted. This sysctl is helpful when you want TPE restrictions
to be limited to a small subset of users.

+Trusted Path Execution is a Linux Security Module that generally requires
+programs to be run from a trusted path. A trusted path is one that is owned by
+root and is not group/world writable. This prevents an attacker from executing
+their own malicious binaries from an unprivileged user on the system. This
+feature is enabled with CONFIG_SECURITY_TPE. When enabled, a set of sysctls
+are created in /proc/sys/kernel/tpe.

+Trusted Path Execution introduces the following Kconfig options and sysctls.

+CONFIG_SECURITY_TPE (sysctl=kernel.tpe.enabled)

+checks are not applied. You can disable the trusted gid option by

+CONFIG_SECURITY_TPE_RESTRICT_ROOT (sysctl=kernel.tpe.restrict_root)
+
+default: n
+
+This option applies TPE restrictions to root.
+
+CONFIG_SECURITY_TPE_INVERT_GID (sysctl=kernel.tpe.invert_gid)
