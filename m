I started to turn this into a module, but after all it doesn't seem like
it would give any real advantage, compared to the current implementation.

This testing is meant to catch bugs in memory management as early as
possible in the boot phase, before users of genalloc start to fail in
mysterious ways.

This includes, but is not limited to: MCE on x86, uncached pages
provider on arm64, dma on arm.

Should genalloc fail, it's highly unlikely that the test rig would even
reach the point where it can load a module and run it, even if it is
located in initrd.

The test would not be run, precisely at the moment where its output
would be needed the most, leaving a crash log that is hard to debug
because of memory corruption.

I do not know how Chrome OS builds are organized, but I imagine that
probably there is a separate test build, where options like lockdep,
ubsan, etc. are enabled.

All options that cannot be left enabled in a production kernel, but are
very useful for sanity checks and require a separate build.

Genalloc testing should be added there, rather than in a module, imho.
