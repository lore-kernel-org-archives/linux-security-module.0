ok :-)

Ah, now I see, I had missed that the field would be set for *all* pages
backed by vmalloc.

So, given a pointer, I still have to figure out if it refers to a
vmalloc area or not.

However, that is something I need to do anyway, to get the reference to
the corresponding page struct, in case it is indeed a vmalloc address.
