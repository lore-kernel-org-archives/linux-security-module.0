I'm not implying that my patch is supposed to provide safety for
"hundreds of other" issues. I'm looking to provide a way to lock down a
single TTY ioctl that has caused real security issues to arise. For
this reason, it's completely incorrect to say that this feature is
snake oil. My patch does exactly what it claims to do. No more no less.

This is precisely what my patch prevents! With my protection enabled, a
container will only be able to use the TIOCSTI ioctl on a tty if that
container has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the user namespace in which the tty was
created.
