You are right, will do it.

Ok will fix it.

Indeed that's better, noted.

I can go with that too. The feature is really useful! and after
thinking about it, it could also be in task and continue to use LSM
hooks, but implemented more like the capability security module, this
way it is more of a core kernel feature than a proper LSM on its own.

Ok, noted.

Thank you for the review!
