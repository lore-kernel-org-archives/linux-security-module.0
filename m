Yeah, agreed; it's limited in scope.

Oops, yes, think-o.

So, if some catch-all is needed, maybe request_module_unpriv(...), but
I think it should be possible to identify SOME kind of defining
privilege to check.

I just want to make sure I'm visualizing this correctly. Using the
misc_open() example, you're thinking something like:

    request_module_dev(file, "char-major-%d-%d", MISC_MAJOR, minor);

which would then do a verification that file->f_cred matched
current_cred()? (For misc_open(), this is obviously going to always be
okay, but other cases may be further from the fops open handler...)

Right, we have both directions -- hotplug module loading ("I saw this
PCI alias, load something! Oh! It needs some fancy crypto too!") and
on-use module loading. It seems like on-use module loading would get
covered by request_module_dev(), and the hotplug case would always be
privileged. Anyway... exploring this with real code is clearly
warranted.

Right, and those would all be privileged, etc.

Yeah, going through the call sites and asking "where does the
privilege for loading this module derive from?" for each one will help
shape the resulting API changes.

This is where a lot of the exposure really comes from. socket()
triggers a bunch of stuff, but doesn't have an obvious privilege
associated with it... while it already does the name templates, maybe
add request_module_socket() just to explicitly mark it?

Okay, excellent. Hopefully we haven't scared off Djalal, and hopefully
Jessica doesn't think this is all insane. :)

Thanks!
