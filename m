Ok, but doesn't that only change the race scenario?

Attempting to free one allocation, while it is in progress, so that all
the "space" bits are written, but the "end bit" is not yet written.
That will eat up also the following, complete allocation, if there is no
locking in place.

But I cannot imagine how to do it, with the split bitmaps, without a
lock :-/
And genalloc is supposed to be lockless.

It was recommended to me because it was a close match to the allocator
that I was writing from scratch and, when I looked at it, I could only
agree that it was very close.

But I have no particular reason for preferring it, if something better
is available. It was just never brought up before.
At least not that I noticed.

Could you please provide me a pointer?
I did a quick search on 4.16-rc5 and found the definition of page_frag
and sk_page_frag(). Is this what you are referring to?
