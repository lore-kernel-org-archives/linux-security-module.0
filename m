CAP_SYS_ADMIN is the right choice here, I agree with Matt: it is
already in use for TIOCSTI. We can't trivially add new capabilities
flags (see the various giant threads debating this, the most recently
that I remember from the kernel lock-down series related to Secure
Boot).

If we're adjusting applications, they should be made to avoid TIOSCTI
completely. This looks to me a lot like the symlink restrictions: yes,
userspace should be fixed to the do the right thing, but why not
provide support to userspace to avoid the problem entirely?
