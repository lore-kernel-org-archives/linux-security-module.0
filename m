Not all systems have a shim layer.??This design is really x86
specific.??Allowing shim keys, but ignoring DB, does not address those
systems.

The reason for trusting enrolled shim keys is because it requires
physical presence. ?(I kind of remember hearing that this changed.
?There is some method of accepting enrolled keys that does not require
physical presence.)

Between requiring a shim layer and relying on physical presence, I'm
not convinced this is the best solution. ?Do we really want to support
different methods for different architectures?
