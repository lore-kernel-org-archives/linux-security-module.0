Subject: [PATCH v3 00/28] simplify crypto wait for async op
Message-ID: <1499006535-19760-1-git-send-email-gilad@benyossef.com>
To: linux-security-module@vger.kernel.org
List-Id: linux-security-module.vger.kernel.org

Many users of kernel async. crypto services have a pattern of
starting an async. crypto op and than using a completion
to wait for it to end.

This patch set simplifies this common use case in two ways:

First, by giving the case where a request was queued to the
backlog a separate return code (-EIOCBQUEUED) of its own
rather than sharing the -EBUSY return code with the fatal
error of a busy provider when backlog is not enabled.

Next, this change is than built on to create a generic way
to wait for a async. crypto operation to complete.

The end result is that after replacing all the call sites
I could find, the code is smaller by ~340 lines, a branch
is saved in some cases in run-time and the code is more
straightforward to follow.

Please note that patches 1-13 should be squashed together
when applied in order to function correctly. They are
only separated out to ease review.

The patch set was boot tested on x86_64 and arm64 which
at the very least tests the crypto users via testmgr and
tcrypt but I do note that I do not have access to some
of the HW whose drivers are modified nor do I claim I was
able to test all of the corner cases.

Last but not least, I do apologize for the size of this
patch set and number of recipients, but I did have to
touch every crypto async API user in the kernel. May the
340 deleted lines serve as penance for my sin :-)

Changes from v2:
- Patch title changed from "introduce crypto wait for
  async op" to better reflect the current state.
- Rebase on top of latest linux-next.
- Add a new return code of -EIOCBQUEUED for backlog
  queueing, as suggested by Herbert Xu.
- Transform more users to the new API.
- Update the drbg change to account for new init as
  indicated by Stephan Muller.

Changes from v1:
- Address review comments from Eric Biggers.
- Separated out bug fixes of existing code and rebase
  on top of that patch set.
- Rename 'ecr' to 'wait' in fscrypto code.
- Split patch introducing the new API from the change
  moving over the algif code which it originated from
  to the new API.
- Inline crypto_wait_req().
- Some code indentation fixes.
