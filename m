I do not think it is just the US that matters here. If I understand
Stefan correctly, one of his concerns is German (or EU?) gov't
standards that are somehow related. I'm very hazy on details.

I emphatically agree with Ted on some points here. Making
FIPS certification a goal for kernel development would be
really dumb. Having multiple RNGs available & compile-time
options to select among them also looks silly to me; we just
need one good one.

On the other hand, I do not see why the driver should not
use a FIPS-compliant PRNG where it can. This would make
things easier for anyone who does seek certification. One
of the big distro vendors? A gov't department or contractor
that wants to use Linux? A corporation's sys admin or
security reviewer? Stefan?

I cannot see much downside to this. Is the current PRNG
more efficient? More easily maintained? Is it still the case
that random(4) must use only hashes, not ciphers, to
avoid restrictions under export laws?
