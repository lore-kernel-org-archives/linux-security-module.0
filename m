My bad. Will fix these issues in v7.

yes <linux/device.h> has dev_warn_ratelimited. I will use that in 7v.

This seems like we would need to expose the owner_user_ns of the tty in procfs
somewhere. Section 1.7 Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt describes the
following files in /proc/tty:

Table 1-11: Files in /proc/tty
..............................................................................
 File          Content
 drivers       list of drivers and their usage
 ldiscs        registered line disciplines
 driver/serial usage statistic and status of single tty lines
..............................................................................

The drivers file is the one that gives the most information that we are
interested in.

However, the current layout combines information about multiple ttys by driver.
As I understand it, a single driver may have ttys that span across different
owner_user_ns. would it make sense to add a file /proc/tty/ns that would
contain the different tty to user namespace mappings? Or is there a better way
to do this? I would appreciate any feedback/ideas you have on this.

v7 will be on its way soon. I'm not currently sure how to address the concern
of giving things like checkpoint/restore in userland a way to get the
owner_user_ns.

Thanks for the feedback,
