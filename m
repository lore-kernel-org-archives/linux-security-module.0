I should split out the additional subject types (uid, gid, cap-based) into a
separate patch, but having them in one patch helped design it.

Fixed.  Now done if KEY_xxx_SEARCH is given.

Does chmod() remove a POSIX ACL from a file?

You have a point, but KEYCTL_DESCRIBE doesn't return the set of permissions
that has been granted to the caller.  The KEYCTL_DESCRIBE interface can't be
made to accurately describe the ACL.

Define 'regular ones'.  For the keys case, do you mean possessor, user, group
and other?

I'm not sure how that helps.  If there's a group ID set, then displaying extra
permissions for it because, say, there's a matching UID-specific ACE present
would be giving a false picture of the permissions set.

You are right.  This should be fixed, assuming we don't move to some other
permissions model.

I'm not sure I agree.  Whilst it doesn't modify the payload of a key, it is
*about* the lifetime of that payload IMO.

However, given that add_key() grants WRITE and SET_SECURITY/SETATTR permission
to the caller (assuming they stick the new key in a keyring they 'possess')
and request_key() grants permission directly to the upcall to set the timeout,
I wonder how much that matters.  It's just that it's not in the same class as
changing the key permissions.

Fix clang?  gcc is the standard.  ;-)

True.  That makes it occupy less space, though.  I could also flip the order
of .mask and .special_id.

One thing I was wondering about is whether I should make the core ACLs R/O and
skip the inc/dec on the refcount if is_kernel_rodata() on the ACL is true.

Yeah, that looks nicer.

'Subject' as in the entity performing the action.  'Specific subject' as
specified by .special_id.  I'm not sure 'specific' is the right word, or
'special' for that matter, but it's how I specify 'macro' things like
'possessor' or 'this key's owner'.

Maybe KEY_ACE_FIXED_SUBJECT or KEY_ACE_MACRO_SUBJECT?  I guess KEY_ACE_UID and
KEY_ACE_GID more fit 'specific subject'.

cred->user_ns as per the cred passed to key_task_permission().

Having dicussed these a bit with Eric Biederman, I'm thinking I probably want
to rejig this, perhaps in favour of specifying the owner of a particular user
namespace.  However, I do think, as mentioned above, I need to split this bit
out into a subsequent patch.

As I stated.  I do have implementations of these now, which I've attached to
the bottom of this message.

I know, but I want to be able to grant just the ability to clear a keyring to
the admin.

Actually, that would've been better - and possibly could've avoided the need
for invalidate - though invalidate is applied to a specific key, not a
keyring.

However, what do you do about key replacement where a link to an old key is
replaced by add_key() with a link to a new key?  Do you have to have both
permits?  Or a third REPLACE permit?

> No magic numbers please.  What are 0x3f and 0x1f?

Things I don't have symbols for.  I would like to avoid using KEY_OTH_xxx when
referring to values that weren't originally 'other'.  I didn't succeed,
though, as I'm sure you noticed, so I could just use combinations of
KEY_OTH_xxx, I guess.

The UAPI is defined so.

Further, key_task_permission() in current Linus will fail if this is not so.

It isn't, except if one calls KEYCTL_SETPERM or if a keyring is created by
join_session_keyring() or as a normal session keyrign.  add_key() creates
keyrings with default_key_acl.

Without this patch, join_session_keyring() doesn't impose any permissions on
joining a keyring, though find_keyring_by_name() requires SEARCH permission on
a named keyring to be able to find it (and still does - though this should
perhaps be switched to JOIN also).

Yes, LINK permission can be used to 'possess' a keyring - but only if you're
granted it.

I can alter KEYCTL_SETPERM to only give KEY_ACE_JOIN if KEY_ACE_SEARCH.

The problem is that I have to supply JOIN to be backwardly compatible, which
makes it arguable that I need to add it to default_key_acl also.

I should probably make it widely available in the main patch and add a
separate patch limiting its availability.

Fixed.  Setting SEARCH sets INVAL in KEYCTL_SETPERM.

I can undo this and defer the thought to a later patch.

Fixed.

No, it can't.  I've fixed the comment.

It was never specified what was meant by specifying multiple permissions and I
don't think I ever used that directly.  The nearest I came was to make
multiple calls to key_{,task_}permission() so that it was obvious in the
caller what was meant.

I know.  But there's no way to render an ACL down to an old-style permissions
mask accurately.  Revocation permission was enabled by having either SETATTR
or WRITE permission, but WRITE permission was disabled under some
circumstances if ->write() didn't exist.

> Also, why isn't JOIN handled here?

What would you represent it as?

Currently, the nearest thing to a JOIN permission is SEARCH, since you need
that to find the keyring by name in the first place; beyond that, there is no
permission needed to join a keyring.

I can make JOIN enable SEARCH, but if you pass it back to KEYCTL_SETPERM,
you're going to enable SEARCH and JOIN, even if you didn't have SEARCH before.

There isn't an easy answer.

There isn't really a viable alternative.  perm isn't what you, the caller,
have available to you.

Good idea.  I was thinking that could only deal with objects in which the
rcu_head was first, but that doesn't appear to be the case.

Fixed.

I dislike that.  I've changed it to:

static struct key_acl thread_and_process_keyring_acl = ...

Point.  Fixed.

Yeah - this should be its own patch.  If you create a named keyring with
KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING, doing this again in another process with the same
name ought to join the first one if it's owned by you and lets you find it.

As previously mentioned, just JOIN should probably be used.  In effect, SEARCH
is also being split from JOIN.

No.  Current code requires SEARCH (or CAP_SYS_ADMIN +
KEY_FLAG_ROOT_CAN_INVAL), not SETATTR.  It was *your* proposal to make it use
SETATTR instead.

SELinux will need fixing if you want to be able to do that.  I need to discuss
how to do this with the SELinux people.

Fixed.

The symbol no longer exists.  I've #defined OLD_KEY_NEED_SETATTR to it in
hooks.c.

Changed to SEARCH.

No idea.
