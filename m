Sure, but that's not the common situation.

The bulk of the risk comes from distro kernels, yes. (Though "bug
ridden" is a strong statement. There are and will be bugs, scattered
across a wide portion of the kernel, it's just that modules tend to
cover most of that attack surface.)

This isn't always obvious nor is it easy: a kernel upgrade will
reinstall everything, etc. This is effectively a blacklist, and we
need an easy whitelist approach. And an admin may not want to make it
so hard for themselves to load some special filesystem module that
they have to hunt it down and reinstall it. Or they'll want some
containers to be able to trigger module loading and others not to.
They just want to know their users aren't triggering module loading
that expands the kernel attack surface.

We should strive to make the kernel easy to protect. Expecting admins
to jump through these hoops isn't a sensible way forward.
