This one here has to be run after machine_crash_shutdown(), and so makes most sense inside __crash_kexec(). The wipe code in this patchset must be one of the last things to run before the kexec since the wiped data structures could easily lead to problems if something tried using them later.

I think ordering is important here: The wiping should be the last thing before the kexec jump. Having it on a generic notifier chain risks that later, other callbacks get added that when interleaved could cause problems.

> I understand. For this reason, I think it's best to keep this default-off. As-is, the notifier list call is timed and on the (slow) ARM64 target I'm using, it takes about 3-5 ms to run. I took the "try lock, skip if locked" approach to keep the risk of this code crashing during panic minimal. In my application, the kdump payload is code that then does a full wipe, taking a couple hundred milliseconds.

Not only about the time used, the panicked kernel is not reliable, any more extra logic can make it even not reliable, any pre-kdump extra logic is not a good idea unless it is a must to ensure kdump working.

Cleaning up secret data can be done with makedumpfile + eppic scripts (see the manual of makedumpfile), or it is even possible to do so in kdump kernel with Tao Liu's improvments for makedumpfile previously  (I don't know the status, probably dropped for the time being, but it is possible, cced him).

Thanks
