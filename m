Actually looking at the patch again:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dhowells/linux-fs.git/commit/?h=efi-lock-down&id=78bb0059c3b8304a8d124b55feebc780fb3e0500

If the only thing that folks are paranoid about is reading
arbitrary kernel memory with bpf_probe_read() helper
then preferred patch would be to disable it during verification
when in lockdown mode.
No run-time overhead and android folks will be happy
that lockdown doesn't break their work.
They converted out-of-tree networking accounting
module and corresponding user daemon to use bpf:
