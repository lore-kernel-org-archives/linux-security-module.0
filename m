This can already be "given up" by a process by using seccomp. The
system-wide setting is what's missing here, and that's a whole other
thread already even though basically every distro has implemented the
= 3 sysctl knob level.

This is another one that can be controlled by seccomp. The system-wide
setting already exists in /proc/sys/user/max_user_namespaces.

The attack surface here is relatively small compared to the other examples.

seccomp and maybe a sysctl? I'd have to look at that more carefully,
but again, this isn't a comparable attack-surface/confinement issue.

I don't like blocking a needed feature behind a large super-feature
that doesn't exist yet. We'd be able to refactor this code into using
such a thing in the future, so I'd prefer to move ahead with this
since it would stop actual exploits.
