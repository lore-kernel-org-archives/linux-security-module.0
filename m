Which is really quite pointless as I keep pointing out and you keep
reposting this nonsense.

And assuming no other ioctl could be used in an attack. Only there are
rather a lot of ways an app with access to a tty can cause mischief if
it's the same controlling tty as the higher privileged context that
launched it.

Properly written code allocates a new pty/tty pair for the lower
privileged session. If the code doesn't do that then your change merely
modifies the degree of mayhem it can cause. If it does it right then your
patch is pointless.

In other words, it's yet another weird config option that breaks stuff.


NAK v7.
