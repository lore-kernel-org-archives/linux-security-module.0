Subject: [PATCH 0/4] migrate swapper_pg_dir
Message-ID: <20180529043728.27738-1-yaojun8558363@gmail.com>
To: linux-security-module@vger.kernel.org
List-Id: linux-security-module.vger.kernel.org

Because the offset between swapper_pg_dir and _text is fixed, when
attackers break KASLR, they can calculate the address of swapper_pg_dir,
and then they can apply KSMA(Kernel Space Mirror Attack). The principle
of KSMA is to insert an entry to PGD, and this entry has type of block
with AP = 01, so attackers can read/write kernel memory directly. Details
can reference:

These patches migrate swapper_pg_dir to new place, and there is no
relationship between swapper_pg_dir and _text. Because this is done
during kernel booting, the physical address of new swapper_pg_dir may
be fixed. Do we need to further randomize it?

YaoJun (4):
  Introduce a variable to record physical address of swapper_pg_dir.
  Introduce a variable to record new virtual address of swapper_pg_dir.
  Make tramp_pg_dir and swapper_pg_dir adjacent
  Migrate swapper_pg_dir and tramp_pg_dir.
