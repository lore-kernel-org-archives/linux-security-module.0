VM_PMALLOC sounds fine to me also adding a comment there pointing to
pmalloc documentation would be a good thing to do. The above are flags
that are use only inside vmalloc context and so there is no issue
here of conflicting with other potential user.

I thought you wanted to do:
  check struct page mapping field
  check vmap->flags for VM_PMALLOC

bool is_pmalloc(unsigned long addr)
{
    struct page *page;
    struct vm_struct *vm_struct;

    if (!is_vmalloc_addr(addr))
        return false;
    page = vmalloc_to_page(addr);
    if (!page)
        return false;
    if (page->mapping != pmalloc_magic_key)
        return false;

    vm_struct = find_vm_area(addr);
    if (!vm_struct)
        return false;

    return vm_struct->flags & VM_PMALLOC;
}

Did you change your plan ?

What ever is easier for you. Note that dereferencing such pointer before
asserting this is really a pmalloc page would be hazardous.
