Subject: [PATCH 03/23] KEYS: fix refcount_inc() on zero

From: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>

If a key's refcount is dropped to zero between key_lookup() peeking at
the refcount and subsequently attempting to increment it, refcount_inc()
will see a zero refcount.  Here, refcount_inc() will WARN_ONCE(), and
will *not* increment the refcount, which will remain zero.

Once key_lookup() drops key_serial_lock, it is possible for the key to
be freed behind our back.

This patch uses refcount_inc_not_zero() to perform the peek and increment
atomically.

Fixes: fff292914d3a2f1e ("security, keys: convert key.usage from atomic_t to refcount_t")
