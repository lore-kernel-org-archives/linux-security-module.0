Hello Mimi,

Thanks for your review.

Thanks, I just learned a new word. :-)

If appended_imasig is just a performance improvement, is it really necessary? 
Perhaps if CONFIG_IMA_APPENDED_SIG is enabled then imasig would imply always 
first looking for an appended signature.

My first impression is that yes, it's necessary because pointlessly checking 
for an appended signature at the end of every file covered by FILE_CHECK could 
have a performance impact on the system. On the other hand, it's just a memcmp 
and that may be negligible compared to the cost of reading an xattr. II'll 
have to measure that...

I didn't like the #ifdef here either and tried to find an alternative, but 
couldn't come up with something that was actually better. Perhaps it'll be 
easier with the changes needed in process_measurement to try reading the xattr 
if the appended sig fails.

I decided to add a new CONFIG option because otherwise CONFIG_IMA_APPRAISE 
would have to start depending on CONFIG_KEYS, CONFIG_PKCS7_MESSAGE_PARSER, 
CONFIG_X509_CERTIFICATE_PARSER and others. If you don't mind the extra 
dependencies, I can remove the CONFIG option.

That would require that me maintain a list of IMA hooks that use 
kernel_read_file and update it if any hook is converted to use it. I can do 
that if you think it's worth it (it is if it's unlikely or infrequent that 
hooks get converted to kernel_read_file).

I could also implement appended_imasig for hooks which need IMA to read the 
file and remove the restriction altogether. I'd have to check how hard that 
would be. Also not sure how useful it would be in practice to have those hooks 
supporting an appended signature.

Indeed.

Right, not a good name. I'll change that.

Hopefully not after the changes to make process_measurement try one sig and 
then the other.

I think the most common case for the appended sig verification to fail will be 
that it won't be there than the signature actually failing.

Having to rehash the file is unfortunate but how frequently would that happen?
