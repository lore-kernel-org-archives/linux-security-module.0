Can you clarify what you mean by the "end" here? It looks like the end
is copied over with the user string just before it's passed into
keyctl_dh_compute_kdf().

In any case, I agree that it's dumb to do this allocation in a loop
now. What if instead we just do one big long allocation of zlen, hash
it, and then free it? This has the advantage that it's not allocated
two functions away from where it's used...

Thanks, I've made this change (and split it out into a separate patch)
for v2.
