Don't worry about mscode - that's not an asymmetric key parser.  That's only
ever used directly from verify_pefile_signature().

Currently, we have to retain support for DER-encoded X.509.

But there's no reason we can't have a PEM parser that decodes the PEM and
selects X.509, PKCS#8 or TPM based on the ascii header in that.  PKCS#8 and
TPM don't need to take DER directly.
