I followed your last week discussion and I agreed with your arguments so
it's unfortunate for me that You put me on the opposite side. I agree that
improving kernel code by finding and fixing existing bugs is the ultimate
goal for security features.

On the other hand the whole debugging process (find, report, wait for fix)
takes a lot of time and work and is basically never ending story. That's why
some kind of prevention which protects users in-between is important for
users which priorities maximal security on their systems.

I like your idea about printing warnings. What about:

modules_autoload_mode =0 (default)
_warn_ about non-root module loading and allow

modules_autoload_mode =1
_warn_ about non-root module loading and deny

This way we can start fixing found cases and also give users option for proactive
defense at the same time without breaking general public. The end game (after
a lot of fixes) would be to make 0 and 1 mostly indistinguishable from security
perspective. 

Yours sincerely
