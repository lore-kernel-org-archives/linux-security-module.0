Agreed. ?Yet there are a couple of reasons for having this sort of
indirection. By having the "encrypted" key encrypted/decrypted by a
"trusted" key, the "trusted" key could be updated without impacting
the "encrypted" key. ?This could be used, for example, for key
migration. ?Another reason would be to define a single "trusted" key
sealed to a set of PCRs, which could be used to encrypt/decrypt
multiple symmetric keys.

Nothing is preventing these subsystems from directly using a "trusted"
key.

This discussion is the result of Udit Agarwal's posting a "secure" key
patch. Before defining a new key type, whether it is called "secure"
or "symmetric", we need to understand how the this new key type is
going to be used. ?Will it have a similar ability to impose conditions
on the key release as the TPM? ?Will it have symmetric key support, so
that the symmetric key never needs to be released from the HW?
