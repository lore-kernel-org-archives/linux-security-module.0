Yes, but that's just double encryption: it serves no real security
purpose because at the end of the chain, the symmetric key is released
into kernel memory to use in software crypto.  Unless you're using a
high speed (and high cost) crypto accelerator with HSA, this will
always be the case for bulk crypto.

The other slight problem with this chain of crypto is that I can impose
conditions on the key release from the TPM (well TPM2, since TPM1.2 has
a very weak policy engine) but if we use intermediate steps, those
conditions might not be preserved, so I think the ideal would be a
trusted key being released directly to LUKS or ecryptfs because the TPM
can then verify the policy at actual unseal time.  I get that for the
ecryptfs case you might want one key per file for sharding and sharing,
and that's more like a bulk case because the TPM isn't going to keep up
with the number of unseal operations required.
