I have updated the patch title and description, and I also added
is_ima_appraise_enabled() as the following. Is it good to you?

On the other hand, I am not good on IMA. I have traced the code path
in kimage_file_prepare_segments(). Looks that the READING_KEXEC_IMAGE
doesn't show in selinux_kernel_read_file(). Where is the exact code
in IMA for checking the signature when loading crash kernel file? 

Thanks a lot!

Subject: [PATCH] kexec_file: The integrity must be checked when the kernel is
 locked down

When KEXEC_VERIFY_SIG and IMA appraise are not enabled, kernel should
not allow that the image to be loaded by kexec_file systemcall when the
kernel is locked down.

The original code was showed in Matthew's patch but not in the later
patch set:
