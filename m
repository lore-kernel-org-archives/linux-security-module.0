I don't see why the seccomp way can't be used.  I agree with you that
the seccomp *style* shouldn't be used in bpf code like this, but I
think that Landlock programs can and should just live in the existing
seccomp chain.  If the existing seccomp code needs some modification
to make this work, then so be it.

In other words, the kernel already has two kinds of chaining:
seccomp's and bpf's.  bpf's doesn't work right for this type of usage
across fork(), whereas seccomp's already handles that case correctly.
(In contrast, seccomp's is totally wrong for cgroup-attached filters.)
 So IMO Landlock should use the seccomp core code and call into bpf
for the actual filtering.

For what it's worth, I haven't figured out that Micka?l means about
chaining restrictions involving cookies.  This seems like something
wrong and the design is too complicated.
