There's a difference between "bugs" and "security bugs". Letting
security bugs continue to get exploited because we want to flush out
bugs seems insensitive to the people getting attacked. I'd rather
protect against a class of bug than have to endless fix each bug.

Just to play devil's advocate, wouldn't such a system continue to not
address your physical-console concerns? I wouldn't want to limit the
protection to only containers (but it's a good start), since it
wouldn't protect people not using containers that still have a
privileged TTY attached badly somewhere.

If you're talking about wholistic SELinux policy, sure, I could
imagine a wholistic fix. But for the tons of people without a
comprehensive SELinux policy, the proposed protection continues to
make sense.
