Well, that's not what KEY_LOOKUP_PARTIAL actually does.  KEY_LOOKUP_PARTIAL
allows the returned key to be uninstantiated, negatively instantiated, *or*
positively instantiated; and the callers seem to rely on that.  Perhaps a better
name might have been KEY_LOOKUP_ALLOW_PARTIAL or KEY_LOOKUP_ALLOW_NONPOSITIVE.

On the other hand, without KEY_LOOKUP_PARTIAL, the returned key is required to
be positively instantiated.  However, there is a special case.  Namely, if no
permissions are requested, the returned key is allowed to be negative (as well
as revoked, invalidated, or expired --- though those can happen at any time
anyway until you do down_read(&key->sem)).  I'm questioning whether we need that
special case.

Yes, by the time key_get_instantiation_authkey() returns, the key may have
already been instantiated.  But I'm not too concerned about that, since the
caller must still have had a non-revoked authorization key shortly before.

It's not about the permission checks.  It's about whether a negative key is
allowed to be returned or not.  And I think overloading 'perm' for that is not
really appropriate, and the cause of the bug in keyctl_read_key().  See the
code, it ignores the return value of wait_for_key_construction() if 'perm' is 0:

        if (!(lflags & KEY_LOOKUP_PARTIAL)) {
                ret = wait_for_key_construction(key, true);
                switch (ret) {
                case -ERESTARTSYS:
                        goto invalid_key;
                default:
                        if (perm)
                                goto invalid_key;
                case 0:
                        break;
                }
	}

It already does use key_validate().  But key_validate() is also used in
lookup_user_key(), where it is expected to accept a negative key.

The real problem seems to be that the permissions mask rather than the flags
argument is used to tell lookup_user_key() whether it can return a negative key.

That root is allowed to invalidate or clear a
negative/invalidated/revoked/expired key or keyring but regular users cannot.

Again, the problem seems to be that the 'perm' argument is used for more than
just the permission check.  I think the 'lflags' argument should indicate what
state the key is allowed to be in, not 'perm'.
