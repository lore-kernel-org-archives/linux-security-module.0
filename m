Can you clarify who the listener is in this case?

Note that mount topology events don't leak outside of the mount namespace
they're generated in.

That said, if you, a random user, put a watchpoint on "/" you can see the
mount events triggered by another random user in the same mount namespace.  I
don't see a way to control this except by resorting to the LSM since UNIX
doesn't have 'notify' permission bits.

But for each event, I can associate an object label, derived from the source,
and use f_cred on the notification queue to provide a subject label.

Yep.  Sounds like I need to refer that to the LSM as above.

It's a bit easier for specifically nominated sb sources since you might only
need to do the check once at sb_notify() time.  If there's a general queue
that all sbs contribute to, however, then things become more complicated as
the checks have to be done at do-we-write-into-this-queue? time.

Currently, you can only watch keys that grant you View permission, which might
suffice.

Yeah - the thought had occurred to me, but there needs to be some way to
define a 'source' and a way to connect them.  Also, would you want a general
source that anyone can contribute through, specific sources where you have to
directly connect or namespace-restricted sources?
