I took the "try lock, skip if locked" approach to keep the risk of this code crashing during panic minimal. In my application, the kdump payload is code that then does a full wipe, taking a couple hundred milliseconds.

First, in the standard scenario where you enable this option, then drop into a standard kdump kernel, I don't think it makes a big difference *when* you do this cleanup since someone is going to have to dereference these pointers. IMHO a good reason to do it in the old kernel is that there, the code knows about the layout of all the data structures. To retroactively do this in the kdump kernel is much more complicated, since there you have to reconstruct the structure layouts from symbols or hardcoded struct layouts, and you have to keep this symbol/layout information perfectly in sync with the running kernel.


I know that this is the usual reason people want to do things in 1st
kernel :)   Like the crash_kexec_post_notifiers which was introduced for
people to use at their own risk.  Is it doable for your case to use
crash_kexec_post_notifiers?

This payload will wipe all these keys too, but my critical concern is speed: On the embedded SoCs I'm targeting, the full memory wipe takes too long (hundreds of ms) for an HSM application, so I want to do a targeted wipe of just the keys first. The old kernel I think is the natural place to do this. Adding to that, in my scenario the most likely trigger of a panic is not something like memory corruption, but a trigger of the system's tamper alarms, which would leave the old kernel relatively stable during panic.

Doing that would only rely on information (more or less intact stack pointer, kdump kernel area boundaries) that would be necessary for kdump to succeed anyway.

I disfavor that since it adds double bookkeeping to a lot of places, some of which could be performance critical.
