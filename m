The kernel expects a raw DER formatted PKCS8 certificate.  And as you 
point out, keyctl doesn't grok PEM files.  So, that is why this is being 
done via openssl.  The example above simply shows one how to import a 
private key in PEM format into the kernel keys framework.

To be pedantic, it converts an optionally encrypted PEM to unencrypted 
DER.  But yes, correct.

Same thing applies as above.  The kernel has no PEM parser, so the raw 
DER must be passed in.  openssl asn1parse line simply does that.  It 
strips the PEM layer leaving the raw DER.

However, now that you mention it, the actual command incantation is 
wrong.  It seems openssl asn1parse acts slightly different from openssl 
pkcs8 and so it needs to be modified to add an extra -out parameter.  So 
the example incantation should be:

   openssl genrsa -out /tmp/privkey.2048.pem 2048
   create_tpm_key -s 2048 -w /tmp/privkey.2048.pem /tmp/privkey.2048.tpm
   openssl asn1parse -inform pem -in /tmp/privkey.2048.tpm -noout \
			-out /tmp/privkey.2048.der
   j=`cat /tmp/privkey.2048.der | keyctl padd asymmetric tpm @u`
   echo "TPM key serial is: $j"

Sorry, I should have caught this earlier.
