it all sounds correct on paper, but it's pretty novel
approach and I'm not sure I see all the details in the patch.
When people say "inode" they most of the time mean inode integer number,
whereas in this patch do you mean a raw pointer to in-kernel
'struct inode' ?
To avoid confusion it should probably be called differently.

If you meant inode as a number then why inode only?
where is superblock, device, mount point?
How bpf side can compare inodes without this additional info?
How bpf side will know what inode to compare to?
What if inode number is reused?
This approach is an optimization to compare inodes
instead of strings passed into sys_open ?

If you meant inode as a pointer how bpf side will
know the pointer before the walk begins?
What guarantees that it's not a stale pointer?
