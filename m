Why is mounting debugfs allowed at all?  Last I checked (it has been a while)
the code quality of debugfs was fine for debugging but debugfs was not
safe to mount on a production system.

Maybe the code quality is better now but for a filesystem that is
not supposed to be needed for developers letting us mount debugfs
seems odd.
