This is the only one where I still couldn't find a solution.
If Matthew Wilcox's proposal about implementing the the genalloc bitmap
would work, then this too could be done, but I think this alternate
bitmap proposed has problems. More on it below.

This could be workable, if it's acceptable that the early testing is
performed only when the module is compiled in.
I do not expect the module-based testing to bring much value, but it
doesn't do harm. Is this acceptable?

I think I can describe a scenario where the split bitmaps would not work
(based on my understanding of the proposal), but I would appreciate a
review. Here it is:

* One allocation (let's call it allocation A) is already present in both
bitmaps:
  - its units of allocation are marked in the "space" bitmap
  - its starting bit is marked in the "starts" bitmap

* Another allocation (let's call it allocation B) is undergoing:
  - some of its units of allocation (starting from the beginning) are
    marked in the "space" bitmap
  - the starting bit is *not* yet marked in the "starts" bitmap

* B occupies the space immediately after A

* While B is being written, A is freed

* Having to determine the length of A, the "space" bitmap will be
  searched, then the "starts" bitmap


The space initially allocated for B will be wrongly accounted for A,
because there is no empty gap in-between and the beginning of B is not
yet marked.

The implementation which interleaves "space" and "start" does not suffer
from this sort of races, because the alteration of the interleaved
bitmaps is atomic.

However, at the very least, some more explanation is needed in the
documentation/code, because this scenario is not exactly obvious.

Does this justification for the use of interleaved bitmaps (iow the
current implementation) make sense?
