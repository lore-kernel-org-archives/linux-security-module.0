Good. Do you have a handle on the reasons?

Because I'm assuming it's not /dev/{mem,kmem,port}? Because I'd really
be happier if we just say "those are legacy, don't enable them at all
for modern distros".

That way they'd _stay_ disabled even if somebody cannot handle the
other limitations, like DMA etc.
