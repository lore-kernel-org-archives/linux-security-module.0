I'm not sure what you're actually asking for.  Are you wanting me to push the
lockdown patches upstream separately from the UEFI patches that trigger the
lockdown?  Or do you mean something else?

So you don't want this change:

	config EFI_SECURE_BOOT
		bool "Support UEFI Secure Boot and lock down the kernel in secure boot mode"
		default n
	+	select LOCK_DOWN_KERNEL

but would rather have a separate option asking whether lockdown should be
triggered if detect UEFI secure boot mode?

A sysfs node is pretty pointless.  A number of things that are locked down
need to be locked down during boot.  I could, however, provide a command-line
option to engage it or a kernel config option to unconditionally enable it.

Yes.  As I pointed out, and as I'm sure you know, I have a slew of other
patches that actually *do* lock things down.  I extracted these patches to try
and get some feedback on this bit without spamming various mailing lists with
all the other patches each time.

You're a member of the "make it provably 100% secure or nothing" camp?

I suspect no one knows.  I've been trying to lock down possibilities people
have pointed me at, even if some of them are very theoretical, and a lot of
the patches I've gathered together come from other people, but I don't know
the hardware that a lot of this is dealing with, so I can't answer this
question.

Can we at least decide whether or not we want to put a locked-down mode into
the upstream kernel?  If not, I can drop this effort.
