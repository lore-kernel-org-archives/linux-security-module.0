An appended signature should be another place to look for a signature,
when a signature is required, but it shouldn't make a difference where
the signature is located. ?"imasig" could have implied to look for the
signature in both places - xattr or appended. ?So the new option is
just a hint - a performance improvement.

This might seem picayune, but the difference between "expect" vs.
"hint" impacts the code. (Further explanation inline.)

Using "ifdef" in C code is really discouraged. Normally, it is an
indication that the code needs to be re-factored. ?Assuming we really
need a new CONFIG option, which I'm not sure that we do, I would move
the appended signature code to its own file, define stub functions in
ima.h, and update the Makefile.

The policy parsing should prevent defining appended_imasig on
inappropriate hooks. ?Since the iint->flags might be shared between
hooks, we might still need to test buf, but it could be simplified to:

if (!buf && iint->flags & IMA_APPENDED_DIGSIG_REQUIRED) {

If the appended_sig is just a hint as to where the signature is
located, then we should read the xattr, even if IMA_DIGSIG_REQUIRED is
not specified. ?ima_appraise_measurement() should be updated to
require a signature if either IMA_DIGSIG_REQUIRED or
IMA_APPENDED_SIGNATURE_REQUIRED are specified. ?

Part of the confusion might be due to the naming
-"IMA_APPENEDED_SIGNATURE_REQUIRED".

Is limiting the "if" to the ifdef really necessary??

Suppose an appended signature and an xattr both exist (eg. kernel
modules), but for some reason the appended signature validation fails.
?The code should somehow retry the signature validation with the
xattr.

Unfortunately, if the hash algorithm in the appended signature and the
xattr are not the same, then we would need to re-calculate the file
hash.
