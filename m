Today each security module manages their own module specific data,
for example inode->i_security and file->f_security. This prevents
having two security modules that have inode or file data from being
used at the same time, because they both need to manage those fields.
Moving the management of the module specific data (aka "blobs") from
the security modules to the module infrastructure will allow those
modules to coexist. Restrictions apply, of course, but I don't think
that Landlock uses any of the facilities that would have issues.
