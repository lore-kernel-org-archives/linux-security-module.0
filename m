This answers my question, but in a way that I summarize as "there's no
good reason to include this securelevel-like property".

I think you should simply exclude this property from mode 2.

The module autoloading restrictions aren't meant to reduce root's
powers; they're only meant to protect processes from shooting themselves
and the system in the foot inadvertently (confused deputy).

modules_disabled may be different in that respect, although with the
rest of the kernel lacking securelevel-like support the point is moot.

We had working securelevel in 2.0.34 through 2.0.40 inclusive, but
we've lost it in 2.1+ with cap-bound apparently never becoming as
complete a replacement for it and having been lost/broken further in
2.6.25+.  I regret this, but that's a different story.  Like I say,
module autoloading doesn't even fit in with those restrictions - it's
about a totally different threat model.
