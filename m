BUG() is basically supposed to never be used, as decreed by Linus.
WARN() here is entirely correct: if we encounter a case where
crypto_aead_ivsize(big_key_aead) != GCM_AES_IV_SIZE is not true, we
run the risk of stack memory corruption. If this is an EXPECTED
failure case, then okay, drop the WARN() but we have to keep the
-EINVAL.
