I mostly agree with your sentiment.  I'm saying that, for most uses, I
*don't* buy into the idea that a normal secure-boot-supporting distro
should block debugfs.  I sometimes like to ask people who report
problems to send me the contents of such-and-such file in debugfs, and
I think it should keep working.  Blocking write access to debugfs is
mostly sensible for a lockdown system, but blocking read only makes
sense if you're worried about straight-up bugs or if you think that
debugfs contains protection-worthy secrets.

What I want to see is:

lockdown=protect_integrity: debugfs is read-only, bpf and perf are
unrestricted, iopl and ioperm are disabled, etc.

lockdown=protect_integrity_and_secrecy: debugfs is gone, bpf and perf
are restricted, plus all the restrictions from
lockdown=protect_integrity

Distros should strongly prefer lockdown=protect_integrity (or
lockdown=off) by default.  lockdown=protect_integrity_and_secrecy is
for custom setups, embedded applications, etc.
