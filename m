I don't think that's the argument here.  Secure boot can be used to
protect initramfs, since initramfs comes from the secure boot-verified
bootloader.  That verified initramfs can protect the init binary.

As far as I can tell, what's really going on here is that there's a
significant contingent here that wants to prevent Linux from
chainloading something that isn't Linux.  (There doesn't seem to be a
real benefit to preventing Linux from chainloading Linux, since the
chainloaded Linux is unlikely to let the attacker do much that the
original rooted Linux kernel wouldn't have allowed.)  In particular,
Microsoft, which de facto controls most of the secure boot key
ecosystem, doesn't want Windows to be chainloaded without having its
signature verified.

I admit I'm not quite sure why Microsoft considers this important.
They already require a TPM for all new systems, and any important
secrets can be sealed by the TPM such that a maliciously chainloaded
Windows kernel couldn't access those secrets.  But secure boot
predates the WHQL TPM requirement if I remember correctly, and I
suspect that we're seeing leftover requirements from
secure-boot-but-no-TPM era.
