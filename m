The gain for it being a module is that it can be loaded and tested
separately from the final kernel image and module collection. For
example, Chrome OS builds lots of debugging test modules but doesn't
include them on the final image. They're only used for testing, and
can be separate from the kernel and "production" modules.

I would include the rationale in either a comment or the commit log.
BUG() tends to need to be very well justified these days.

I'll leave it up to the -mm folks, but that was just my thought.
