Naming of this feature has been multi-year bikeshedding, so if we
could just leave the name, that'd be nice.

That is how I view it, yes. It's about creating a bright line between
uid-0 and ring-0. The most powerful of these distinctions was made
long ago with signed modules. It hasn't been enough, though, since
there have been many ways for uid-0 to read or write kernel memory. My
expectation for this was to reasonably fill all the remaining gaps.

FWIW, I've never been a fan of this being UEFI-centric: more than
Secure Boot needs this. For example, Chrome OS's static root of trust
and boot firmware isn't UEFI, but it wants this feature enabled.
Chrome OS would set it on the command line, since the command line is
part of the signed boot image along with the kernel, etc.

I think splitting read and write is only useful if there is a use-case
for only blocking one of them. I struggle to imagine allowing write
and blocking read, so really it's the case of wanting to allow read
and disallow write. Is there actually a use-case for this? In all the
"locked down" cases I've seen, both are desired.
