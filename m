For managing the lifetime of various object types, including
struct user_namespace, the kernel uses reference counting.
You can see that struct user_namespace has a member named
"count" of type atomic_t. This member tracks how many
references to a user namespace exist in the kernel, not counting
some types of temporary references.
Basically, when this counter reaches zero, the kernel assumes that
nothing uses the namespace anymore and frees the
struct user_namespace. Attempting to use the struct user_namespace
after that would cause a use-after-free bug.

This means that when you store a reference to a
user_namespace in a tty_struct, you need to increment the "count"
member of the user_namespace ("take a reference"), and when the
tty_struct is released, you need to decrement the "count" member of
the user_namespace back down ("drop a reference"). To change the
count, you should use the helper functions get_user_ns() and
put_user_ns().
