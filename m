IMHO, we can separate this series into 2 parts, as you did above, and send out them separately. The reason is, in general I think adding new MKTME type to key retention services is not that related to memory management code, namely the encrypt_mprotect() API part.

So if we split the two parts and send them out separately, the first part can be reviewed by keyring and security guys, without involving mm guys, and the encrypt_mprotect() part can be more reviewed more by mm guys. 

And since encrypt_mprotect() is a new syscall, you may need to add more lists for the review, ie, linux-api, and maybe linux-kernel as well.

Thanks,
