This is interesting work, though it adds complexity and makes a lot of subtle
(and potentially breaking) changes to which permissions are required for various
things.  First I think you need to start out with a better statement of the
problems you are trying to solve.  The patch does much more than simply split up
the SETATTR permission --- for example, it also adds the ability to assign
permissions to specific uids, gids, and capabilities.  Who is planning to use
those features and why?

The proposed changes to keyctl_setperm_key() actually never enable INVAL at all,
which doesn't match the description here.  Also, all breaking changes need to be
justified.  If keyctl_setperm(key, KEY_*_SEARCH) is no longer going to allow the
key to be invalidated (as I had proposed earlier), that is really its own change
which needs its own justification; it shouldn't be hidden in a larger patch.

That is simplest, but it doesn't match the behavior of POSIX ACLs, for example.
With POSIX ACLs you can still chmod() a file that has an ACL.

Ignoring ACEs for specific users, groups, and capabilities may be problematic
because the returned mask will under-estimate rather than over-estimate the
permissions that have been granted.  With POSIX ACLs, for example, the union of
all permissions that have been granted to any subjects other than the regular
ones is reflected in the group entry.  I believe that's generally considered
better from a security perspective, because then no permissions are "hidden"
from a listing of the regular (non-ACL) permissions only.

Not true; you *can* set READ on a key that lacks ->read() and WRITE on a key
that lacks ->update().  They are only omitted from the default permissions.

This doesn't match the code, which asks for WRITE permission only.  It's also a
breaking change which needs to be justified on its own.  Also I'm not sure that
WRITE permission actually makes sense, given that KEYCTL_SET_TIMEOUT doesn't
modify the payload of the key.

Designators into flexible arrays are a gcc extension which doesn't work with
clang.  Use this instead:

	.aces = {
		{
			.mask = KEY_ACE_SPECIAL | (KEY_ACE_SEARCH | KEY_ACE_READ),
			.special_id = KEY_ACE_POSSESSOR,
		},
		{
			.mask = KEY_ACE_SPECIAL | (KEY_ACE_VIEW | KEY_ACE_SEARCH),
			.special_id = KEY_ACE_OWNER,
		},
	},

It's also difficult to read these lists of ACEs.  An ACE should read as "who",
then "what".  But now it reads as "part of who", then "what", then "the rest of
who".  It may be helpful to define some macros to create the entries more
concisely:

	.aces = {
		KEY_POSSESSOR_ACE(KEY_ACE_SEARCH | KEY_ACE_READ),
		KEY_OWNER_ACE(KEY_ACE_VIEW | KEY_ACE_SEARCH),
	}

This is ugly.  How about using kernel_key_ace for the internal kernel version?

The implementations of these don't seem to be included in the patch.

The CLEAR permission is weird because WRITE is a superset of it.  (Clearing a
keyring is equivalent to unlinking all keys in it.)  Permissions should be
orthogonal.  Did you consider instead having one permission for adding links to
a keyring and one for deleting links?  I'm thinking about use cases similar to
that which the sticky bit on files is used for...

No magic numbers please.  What are 0x3f and 0x1f?

Also, this code is assuming that the subject values are numbered in a certain
way.  There should be some BUILD_BUG_ON()s to verify that.

Why is JOIN permission always given to keyrings?  If someone has JOIN permission
(or LINK permission, for that matter) on a keyring than they can acquire the
possessor permissions.  So always giving JOIN defeats the point of having all
the different non-possessor permissions...

Granting INVAL permission is missing.

As mentioned earlier, this is a breaking change which needs to be justified on
its own.

Why call groups_search() when the key gid isn't valid?

Not sure I understand this.  So if someone owns the key, then they actually have
all the "root" privileges as well, since they can create and enter a new user
namespace where they are "root"?  That may not be what people expect.

Also known as capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN).  But also, why does it handle namespaces
differently from KEY_ACE_ROOT?

capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN), and see above.

This is wrong because 'desired_perm' may contain multiple permissions --- and if
*any* are denied, then the permission check should fail.  It should be:

	if (desired_perm & ~allow)
		goto no_access;

The handling for REVOKE is weird, since it makes it possible that by *adding*
permissions, it can appear that WRITE permission was removed.

Also, why isn't JOIN handled here?

Again, ignoring the "non-special" ACEs will cause the returned permissions mask
to be an under-estimate rather than an over-estimate.  I'm not sure that's a
good idea.

Use kfree_rcu().

Bug: this will break from the loop if it encounters an ACE for uid or gid 4 (the
value of KEY_ACE_POSSESSOR).  It needs to check for KEY_ACE_SPECIAL before
special_id == KEY_ACE_POSSESSOR can be considered meaningful.

It's not obvious what 'tp' means.  How about:

static struct key_acl thread_keyring_acl = {
	...

#define process_keyring_acl thread_keyring_acl

Why give JOIN permission to anonymous session keyrings? They shouldn't be
joinable --- and they weren't prior to this patch, since they were *not* given
KEY_USR_SEARCH permission.

This is also a behavior change which needs to be explained and justified on its
own.  A named keyring created with keyctl_join_session_keyring(name) was not
previously joinable by default, but after this patch it is.

find_keyring_by_name() also checks for SEARCH permission.  Now this checks for
JOIN as well.  Is it intentional that two different permissions are being
checked?

Isn't this going to need to be SETATTR rather than SEARCH?  Even if we can't
update SELinux to be aware of the new-style permissions we still need to fix the
"search also means delete" bug.  Otherwise it will remain impossible to use
SELinux to enforce a read-only view of a key hierarchy.

Another breaking change which needs to be explained and justified.  Before
either the write or setattr SELinux key permissions was sufficient for
revocation, but now only write is.

Magic number.

The old-style permission for joining keyrings was SEARCH, not LINK.  Probably it
*should* have been LINK, but it's still a breaking change which needs to be
justified on its own...
