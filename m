The good news here is that this series comes with an expected user:
systemd, for which I suspect this will option will get wider and wider
use.

Another bit of good news is that systems _depending_ cap-less module
loading are uncommon enough that many system builders can enable this
protection and nothing will break. (Even you thought it was rare
enough that we could just make this default-enabled.)

Besides, distros understand that they have to keep an eye out for
these things since the kernel has a long history of not allowing
default-enabled protections that change userspace behavior, etc.

The issue isn't "is it always okay to cap-less-load this module?" it's
"should the kernel's attack surface be allowed to grown by an
unprivileged user?" Nearly all the request_module() sites have already
been audited and adjusted to avoid _arbitrary_ module loading (usually
by adding module prefixes: netdev-, crypto-, etc), and that greatly
helped reduce the ability for a unprivileged user to load a
known-buggy module, but there will remain many subsystems that
continue to expect to grow the kernel's features on demand within
their subsystem, and sometimes those modules will have bugs that an
unprivileged user can exploit (this history of this happening is quite
real; it's not a theoretical concern). This is especially problematic
for distro kernels where they build tons of modules.

There isn't a way for an admin to say "I only want root to be able to
load modules". They can't delete all the "unused" kernel modules,
because maybe root will want the module, they can't change module file
permissions because the modules are read with init's permissions (and
it would be terrible to repeatedly change all the file perms each time
a new kernel got installed), modules can only be blacklisted (not
whitelisted) in /etc/modprobe.d/, etc.

I don't disagree that a global should be avoided, but I'm struggling
to see another option here. We can't break userspace by default so we
can't restrict cap-less loading by default. But we can allow userspace
to _choose_ to break itself, especially within a container. This isn't
uncommon, especially for modules, where we even have the global
"modules_disabled" sysctl already. The level of granularity of control
here is the issue, and it's what this series solves.

The options I see for module loading control are:
1) monolithic kernel (no modules)
2) modular kernel that flips on modules_disabled after boot (no
modules after boot)
3) modular kernel that allows per-subsystem unpriv module loading (all
modules loadable)

There is a demand for something between 2 and 3 where only root can
load modules. (And as pointed out in the series, this is _especially_
true for containers where the admin may want to leave module loading
alone in the init namespace, but stop any module loading in the
container.)
