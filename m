This series came up in discussions with Dave Chinner (and Matthew
Wilcox, already part of the discussion, and others) at LCA. I wonder
if XFS would make a good initial user of this, as it could allocate
all the function pointers and other const information about a
superblock in pmalloc(), keeping it separate from the R/W portions?
Could other filesystems do similar things?

Do you have other immediate users in mind for pmalloc? Adding those to
the series could really help both define the API and clarify the
usage.
