Yes.

For your pleasure:
https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/25/brickerbot-is-a-vigilante-worm-that-destroys-insecure-iot-devices/
 bricked million of devices to stupid busybox remote port.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)  an other million bots
used to disturb netflix, twitter and others I don't know the details.

I didn't say that.

The product costs decide, web developers, javascript, big data
analysis, electronic engineers all want to use Linux for IoT prototype
and sell in some months, they will get any kernel+userspace add their
value on top and sell. It will be non-sense to think that if a web
developer wants to sell a node.js app as an IoT he has to compile a
kernel and do all the other stuff, they all re-use the same layer the
same config for everything. Requiring for everyone to compile its own
kernel does not make much sense. Default safe behaviour is what we
should do.

Thanks!
