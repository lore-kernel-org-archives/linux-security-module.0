The opcode is relatively easy to extract from the mailbox and pass to the LSM.
All drivers implement some variant of mlx5ctl_validate_rpc()/devx_is_general_cmd()
to validate the opcode. The problem is that this check alone is not sufficient.

Ultimately, the LSM must make a decision for each executed firmware  
command. This will need to be handled one way or another, and will  
likely require parsing the mailbox again.

The difference here is that the proposed LSM hook is intended to disable
certain functionality provided by the firmware, effectively depending on
the operator’s preferences.

This is not a security‑sensitive operation that requires strict
restriction.

They trust the firmware and the kernel, but they do not trust the actual  
non‑privileged users of that firmware.
