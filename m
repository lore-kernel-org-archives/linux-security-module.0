It does not need to track TSYNC (since the results of that flag are
represented in the filter tree itself).

I didn't see an obvious way to extend the existing
PTRACE_SECCOMP_GET_FILTER to also return flags, so I think either a
new function for just flags or a new versioned function for rules and
flags will be needed.

Okay, great! Thanks!
