I thought I got rid of all of them, but some have escaped me

I thought about it, but typedef came to my mind and knowing it's usually

I didn't think this could be acceptable either. But if it is, then ok.

Which means that it should not be normal sysfs, but rather debugfs, if I
understand correctly, since in sysfs 1 value -> 1 file.
