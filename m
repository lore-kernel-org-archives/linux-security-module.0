Parsing RPMs is not strictly necessary. Digests from the headers
can be extracted and written to a new file using the compact data
format (introduced with patch 7/12).

At boot time, IMA measures this file before digests are uploaded to the
kernel. At this point, only files with unknown digest will be added
to the measurement list. At verification time, verifiers recreate the
measurement list by merging together the digests uploaded to the
kernel with the unknown digests. Then, they verify the obtained list.

There are two ways to verify the digests: searching them in a reference
database, or checking a signature. With the 'ima-sig' measurement list
template, it is possible to verify signatures for each accessed file.
With this patch set, it is possible to verify the signature of
the file containing the digests uploaded to the kernel. If the data
format changes, the signature cannot be verified.

To avoid this limitation, the parsers could be moved to a userspace
tool which then uploads the parsed digests to the kernel. IMA would
measure the original files. But, if the tool is compromised, it could
load digests not included in the parsed files. With the current solution
this problem does not arise because no changes can be done by userspace
applications to the uploaded data while digests are parsed by IMA.

I could remove the RPM parser from the patch set for now.

Is the remaining part of the patch set ok, and is the explanation of
what it does clear?

Thanks

Roberto
