I understand, though that with today's container recycling use cases
some of it may make sense. Anyway you are doing the real work, you
know better.

Indeed!

I perfectly agree here. With Tetsuo patch it was easy to add a
stackable LSM, with a consistent approach that would be even better.
But as you note that should not be a blocker to upstream new stackable
LSMs.

Ok Casey! I will wait for more feedback, and if other maintainers do
not object, I will convert it back to rhashtables in next iterations
making sure that it should be simple to convert later to a blob
sharing mechanism.

Thanks again for the comments!
