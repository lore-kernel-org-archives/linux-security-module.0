Yes, breaking customers is not seen lightly.

I also (not related to this thread here, more to SLAB hardening et.al)
have a hard time getting performance losses caused by hardening features approved.

Speaking for SUSE ... If something that worked for people before and
it breaks, we do get feedback. If no one used it however, we won't.

For our last major product we went over the network module list and 
disabled some for building. e.g. DCCP is no longer built. We did
not receive any complaints about missing DCCP to my knowledge.

We also seperate our modules into "regular supported" and "unsupported"
in different RPMs. The "unsupported" module packages are not shipped on
the Server product. They were shipped on the desktop as some of the WiFi
drivers were requested by customers but were considered not supportable.

We do review this supportable list between kernel version jumps.

Ciao, Marcus
