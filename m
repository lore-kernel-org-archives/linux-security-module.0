The trampoline table that has been implemented for the iOS port (MACH)
is based on PC-relative data referencing. That is, the code and data
are placed in adjacent pages so that the code can access the data using
an address relative to the current PC.

This is an ISA feature that is not supported on all architectures.

Now, if it is a performance feature, we can include some architectures
and exclude others. But this is a security feature. IMO, we cannot
exclude any architecture even if it is a legacy one as long as Linux
is running on the architecture. So, we need a solution that does
not assume any specific ISA feature.

If you put the code in the libffi shared object, how do you pass data to
the code at runtime? If the code we are talking about is a function, then
there is an ABI defined way to pass data to the function. But if the
code we are talking about is some arbitrary code such as a trampoline,
there is no ABI defined way to pass data to it except in a couple of
platforms such as HP PA-RISC that have support for function descriptors
in the ABI itself.

As mentioned before, if the ISA supports PC-relative data references
(e.g., X86 64-bit platforms support RIP-relative data references)
then we can pass data to that code by placing the code and data in
adjacent pages. So, you can implement the trampoline table for X64.
i386 does not support it.

IIRC, I have answered all of those comments by mentioning the point
that we need to support all architectures without requiring special
ISA features. Taking the kernel's help in this is one solution.

I apologize for that. That site is supposed to be accessible publicly.
I will contact the administrator and get this resolved.

Sorry for the annoyance.

I agree. The complexity is about the same. But the support is for all
architectures. Once the common code is in place, the changes for each
architecture are trivial.
