Is this correct?

The old code invoked a check with the same comment through mount_ns();
however, this patch changes the semantics of the check.
The old code checked that the caller has privileges over the user
namespace that contains the PID namespace; in other words, it checked
that the caller has privileges over the PID namespace. The current
code just checks that the caller is privileged over its own user
namespace.

As far as I can tell, this means that by doing something like this:

    unshare(CLONE_NEWNS|CLONE_NEWUSER);
    mount("none", "/", NULL, MS_REC|MS_PRIVATE, NULL);
    mount("proc", "/proc", "proc", 0, "newinstance,pids=all");

any process could create a new unrestricted procfs mount for its PID
namespace, even if it is only supposed to have access to a more
restricted procfs mount.
