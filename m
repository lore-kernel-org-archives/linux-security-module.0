well, this is embarrassing ... yes I had this prototype code, because I
was wondering if it wouldn't make more sense to tear down the pool as
fast as possible. It slipped in, apparently.

I'm actually tempted to leave it in and fix the comment.

How common are multi-threaded allocations of write-once memory?
Here we are talking exclusively about the part of the memory life-cycle
where it is allocated (from pmalloc).

An example of how to use a mutex to access a shared resource? :-O

This part below, under your question, was supposed to be the answer :-(

Because, as written, on 32 bit system the vmalloc range is relatively
small, so one might wonder if there are enough addresses.

Quite the opposite.
I thought it was clear, but obviously it isn't, I'll reword this.
