The firmware signature validation should occur as part of
kernel_read_file_from_path(), not as a stand alone verification.

Why not extend kernel_read_file_from_path() to pass the detached signature? ?Since the signature would only be used for the verification, there's no need to return the open file descriptor.

Or if you prefer, call kernel_read_file_from_path() for the detached signature first, and then call it again for the firmware with a pointer to the detached signature.

How are the keys in the CFG80211_EXTRA_REGDB_KEYDIR verified? ?The
call to key_create_or_update() with the KEY_ALLOC_BYPASS_RESTRICTION
option by-passes any requirement that the keys in this directory are
signed. ?This by-passes the concept of extending the secure boot
signature chain of trust. ?To safely validate the keys use the
restrict_link_by_builtin_trusted option.
