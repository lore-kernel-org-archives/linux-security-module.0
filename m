Or you could just use pty/tty pairs properly the way sudo and other
applications do perfectly well.

Lots of them are potential security issues - if I sent your console to
1x1 char, change the font and keymap you'd proably be peeved 8-)

It's not about hardening against all these (which would break lots of
legitimate use cases), it's about having the affected applications do the
right thing.

It makes sense that TIOCSTI honours namespaces. However it and everything
else are correctly handled by creating the lower security level process
with its own pty/tty pair.
