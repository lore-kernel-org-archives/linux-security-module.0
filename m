If the user can arbitrarily modify the running kernel image, you cannot trust
anything.  You cannot determine the trustworthiness of something because your
basis for determining that trust can be compromised.

Stopping the kernel from being arbitrarily modified allows you to preserve
your trust.

Stopping the kernel from being arbitrarily read stops any encryption keys it
may be using from being retrieved.

And, if you can't guarantee the trustworthiness of your own image, you can't
pass the trust onto the next image that you kexec.

Now, I can't guarantee that my patches close every hole, they just close all
the holes I know about - including some obscure ones like using DMA-capable
ISA devices to hack/access the kernel image.
