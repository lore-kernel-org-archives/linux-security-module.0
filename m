I would prefer to use a different terminology, because, if I have
understood the use case, this is not exactly the same as __ro_after_init

So, this is my understanding:

* "const" needs to be known at link time - there might be some
adjustments later on, ex: patching of "const" pointers, after relocation
has taken place - I am assuming we are not planning to patch const data
The compiler can perform whatever optimization it feels like and it is
allowed to do, on this.

* __ro_after_init is almost the same as a const, from a r/w perspective,
but it will become effectively read_only after the completion of the
init phase. The compiler cannot use it in any way to detect errors,
AFAIK. The system will just generate a runtime error is someone tries to
alter some __ro_after_init data, when it's read-only.
The only trick available is to use, after the protection, a different
type of handle, const.

* pmalloc pools can be protected (hence the "p") at any time, but they
start as r/w. Also, they cannot be declared statically.

* data which is either const or __ro_after_init is placed into specific
sections (on arm64 it's actually the same) and its pages are then marked
as read-only.

I doubt this would work, because I think it's not possible to put a
field of a structure into a separate section, afaik.

__ro_after_init would refer to the ro field, not to the memory it refers to.

is this something that is readonly from the beginning and then shared
among mount points or is it specific to each mount point?

The "const" modifier is a nice way to catch errors through the compiler,
iff the ro data will not be initialized through this handle, when it's
still writable.

yes, anyway the first one trying to alter it at run time, is in for some
surprise.

That was my same sentiment.

Actually it would be even possible to simulate caches with pools: each
pool supports a granularity parameter, during creation. One could have
multiple pools, each with different granularity, but it would probably
lead to a proliferation of pools.

Instead, I preferred to have pmalloc as a drop-in replacement for the
variants of k/v/kv malloc.

The only real issue was the - previous - inability of tracking the size
of an allocation, given its address, but that is taken care of by the
patch for the genalloc bitmap.

If I could have a pointer to a good candidate for the pmalloc treatment,
I could come up with a patch, to show how it could be done.

Then it might be easier to discuss if the API needs to be modified
and/or extended somehow.
