That was indeed my first thought - I wanted to change EBUSY to EAGAIN.
It might even be a more descriptive error message since the failure is
transient.

What stopped me was that I saw the algif interface passes this EBUSY value
to user space. I don't know of any software that depends on this value but
I'm really averse to changing user space API.

Of course, we can just plant a (ret != AGAIN : ? EBUSY) in the algif interface
return to user space code path but that felt like a kludge to me.

And it doesn't really save any churn, I think - I'd still have to
visit all the places that
use the flags value to distinguish between the two EBUSY use cases and  I need
to visit most places that check for EBUSY as backlog indication because I'm
replacing the check with the generic replacement, so it doesn't look
like in the end
it will be a smaller change.

Having said that, if you prefer me to replace the error case I'd
happily do that.

Thanks,
Gilad
