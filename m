I still think removing all logging traces is a mistake for something
that can consume a significant amount of time in the boot sequence.
?It's going to cause lost of people doing boot timings to waste lots of
effort.

However, removing the log messages makes the above statement a lie, so
one of the two needs fixing.

There shouldn't be a \n in the string: the failure message already
appends one.
