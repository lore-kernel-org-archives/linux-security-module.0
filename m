This is what we as a community came up with in 2008:

  "Essentially, any new security project?not limited to LSMs?should be 
   accompanied by a clear and concise document outlining its requirements 
   and expected uses. This is to allow both security and regular folk to 
   perform review of the code in terms of how it meets the specified 
   requirements, and to avoid getting bogged down in unresolvable 
   discussions about the project?s security model."

(Not sure if the original document at Kernel Trap still exists, alas).

So what we need is clear design documentation that the code can be 
reviewed against.  There is nothing about the number of users.  If the 
code is simply using the existing API and meets its design goals, it's 
pretty straightforward.  If changes to the API or core kernel are also 
required, then more discussion and review will be needed.
