I think it should be OK.  It is highly unlikely that we get another 
OCTET string type format, and even then we can actually peek inside and 
try to parse the TPM structure carried in the DER if there is indeed a 
conflict.

Also, after refreshing my memory of how PEM format is actually 
specified, I'm no longer convinced that having it in the kernel is such 
a good idea.  It would probably be made to work, but the PEM file format 
itself isn't that precise, at least compared to DER.

James, is there a document / official place with your TPMKey ASN.1 
format?  The only reference I can find is here:
https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jejb/openssl_tpm2_engine/+/93b2f4f3f0f2260292f54de4e6333219063c77b1/tpm2-asn.h
