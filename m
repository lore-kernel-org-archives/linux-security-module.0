Subject: [PATCH 00/24] security: Add kernel lockdown

Hi Linus,

I've modified my lockdown mode patches to remove the EFI/secure-boot
interaction and to ignore kexec.  Would you be willing to accept this?

Here's a set of patches to institute a "locked-down mode" in the kernel.
If enabled, the lockdown can be triggered either by configuration (in which
case it cannot be lifted) or by command line (lockdown=1).  In the latter
case, there's an option to allow it to be lifted by a SysRq key on an
attached keyboard.

Three config options are provided:

 (1) CONFIG_LOCK_DOWN_KERNEL makes lockdown mode available.

 (2) CONFIG_LOCK_DOWN_MANDATORY builds the kernel with lockdown mode
     enabled at compile time and removes the ability to disable it.

 (3) CONFIG_ALLOW_LOCKDOWN_LIFT_BY_SYSRQ will allow a SysRq combination to
     lift the lockdown.  On x86 this is SysRq+x.  The keys must be pressed
     on an attached keyboard.  Echoing into the trigger file won't work.

Inside the kernel, kernel_is_locked_down() is used to check if the kernel
is in lockdown mode.

For the moment, there is only one mode that locks everything down.  Andy
would prefer that there be two modes, one of which allows the kernel to be
read, but not modified and the other which allows neither.  Modifying this
later to allow what Andy wants wouldn't be particularly hard as there isn't
much additional functionality that this would enable (ie. /dev/kmem,
/dev/kcore, bpf and perf).

A manual page, kernel_lockdown.7, is proposed, to which people will be
directed by messages in dmesg.  This lists the features that are restricted
amongst other things.

The patches are tagged here:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dhowells/linux-fs.git
	tags/lockdown-20180410
