Yuqiong is publishing a paper in this area. I believe the conference is 
only later this year.

Our goals are to enable IMA measurements, appraisal, and auditing inside 
a container using namespaces. IMA measurements are about logging files 
that were read or executables that were started on a machine, appraisal 
is about locking down the machine and only allowing files to be accessed 
that have been properly signed. We certainly want to prevent the abuse 
of namespaces by users to do things that go undetected. A primary 
concern are activities of root in the TCB.

Support for IMA in namespaces should enable the following:

- IMA policy for container (similar to the host):
   - there should be an initial default policy for every IMA namespace 
that measures activities inside the container
   - the policy can be overwritten once with a user-defined policy that 
may activate appraisal

- IMA policy extensions due to namespacing:
   - an IMA policy should allow rules that define whether activities in 
(all) child namespaces is to be measured (prevents huge logs on the host)
   - to prevent root from spawning new IMA namespaces and doing things 
undetected in the TCB, all activities of root are (recursively) measured 
in all IMA namespaces independent of whether the policy enables logging 
in child namespaces

- IMA appraisal and keys:
   - each IMA namespace should have its own keyring so that each 
container can have its files signed with different keys
   - it should be possible to enforce that only certified keys are 
loaded onto a keyring, similar to .ima on the host

- IMA auditing:
   - auditing should report activity in namespaces following the IMA 
policy; root's activities in containers should be audited

- TPM and measurements:
   - The IMA namespace that holds the logs should be configurable to 
extend PCRs; since the single TPM of the host cannot be shared by 
containers, each IMA namespace would have to be associated with its own 
TPM instance (vTPM); measurement on the initial IMA namespace are 
extended into the hardware TPM asdone today


A concrete 'ab-use' case that we are trying to avoid is the following:
- a user creating a privileged container that shares the host's mount 
namespace: it would be unexpected if there is an IMA policy active on 
the host that enforces file appraisal but in this case the IMA policy is 
not enforced since a (hypothetical) IMA namespace of the host was not 
joined since only the mount namespace of the host was joined. Now we 
have two choices here: We tie the mount and IMA namespaces together via 
sinlge clone flag, as proposed, and joining the mount namespace 
automatically joins the associated IMA namespace (single setns()). Or we 
make user space responsible for it and say if a mount namespace is 
joined, find the associated IMA namespace (how to do that?), and join 
both of them (2 setns() calls). Well, I think the former would preferred 
over the latter.

Let's assume we tie MNT and IMA together, then there are other scenarios 
with switching through the other namespaces (UTS, PID, IPC, NET, USER, 
CGROUP). I am not sure what is supposed to happen other than logging the 
activity active in the current IMA namespace:

What should happen with IMA logging, appraisal, and auditing if we 
setns() through all available
- PID namespaces and send signals: log, appraise, and audit file 
activity following IMA policy
- IPC namespaces and send messages via IPC: same as for PID
- UTS namespaces and setting hostname:  same as for PID
- NET namespaces and sending network traffic: same as for PID?
- CGROUP namespaces and configuring cgroups: same as for PID?
- USER: should now the keys of this USER namespace be active or the keys 
of the original user namespace used during the clone()? other than that, 
same as for PID?

Yes, we want to prevent 'abuse', especially by root. See above.

The container runtime will be able to overwrite a default IMA policy 
that is active upon spawning an IMA namespace. This policy has to be 
useful in so far that it must enable a gapless measurement chain and for 
example show keys that were loaded into keyrings or the IMA policy that 
was loaded.
