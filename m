That's a good question.? Based upon those articles, 'yes'.? But it seems 
like a 'darned-if-you-do, darned-if-you-don't' question as couldn't you 
also corrupt a mounted filesystem by crashing the kernel, yes/no?

If you really want a system crash, maybe just do a panic() like 
filesystems also use?
