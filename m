I don't think so. The machine can still boot and work just fine, but
big key crypto will not be available. I suspect there are some
machines out there that don't need big key, so there's no reason for
the boot to fail. That's the rub about WARN vs BUG -- that in most
cases things can continue on happily.

But the algorithm is hard coded at the top of the file, so one check
is enough.
