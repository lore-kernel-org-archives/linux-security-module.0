We could even do this in a more thorough way. Can we use a ring 1 / 2
distinction to create a hardened OS core that policies the rest of
the ever expanding kernel with all its modules and this and that feature?

I think that will long term be a better approach and allow more than the
current hardening approaches can get you. It seems that we are willing to
tolerate significant performance regressions now. So lets use the
protection mechanisms that the hardware offers.
