Thanks for looking it over!

I wasn't super happy with the END_LSM thing, but I wanted to be able
to declare the name as __initconst, otherwise it needlessly stays in
memory after init. That said, it's not a huge deal, and maybe
readability trumps a tiny meory savings?

I thought the structure instances would need a unique name, but it
seems the section naming removes that requirement. This seems only to
be needed if we had multiple LSMs defined in the same source file.
Though I wonder if this would be a problem for LTO in the future?

I'm happy to do whatever.
