Right, the above change is almost right. ?Instead of preventing the
kexec_load syscall based on CONFIG_KEXEC_VERIFY_SIG it should be based
on a runtime secure boot flag. ?Only if there is an arch specific
secure boot function and the secure boot flag is enabled, would the
kexec_load be disabled.

Without an architecture specific secure boot function, the existing
IMA code would fail the kexec_load syscall.

True, but for now to coordinate between the two signature verification
methods, only if CONFIG_KEXEC_VERIFY_SIG is not enabled would an IMA
architecture specific rule be defined.
