Can you explain that much more clearly?  I'm asking why booting via
UEFI Secure Boot should enable lockdown, and I don't see what this has
to do with kexec.  And "someone blacklist[ing] your key in the
bootloader" sounds like a political issue, not a technical issue.

What is the actual purpose of these patches?

Can you please explain the actual attack that is avoided by doing this?

Suppose I'm a bad guy attacking someone's laptop.  If I just have
normal uid!=0 access, then these patches have no effect.  Instead,
we're talking about an attacker who is somehow able to become global
root and bypass all LSM restrictions but has not gained kernel code
execution.  It is indeed the case that your patches make it harder to
simply read the dm-crypt encryption key out of main memory.  But root
can attack the disk encryption in many other ways.  They can
persistently compromise the machine by adding services or user
accounts or intentionally misconfiguring something.  They can directly
read the entire contents of the disk.  They can modify the initrd so
that the next time the machine reboots and the user types the
password, the attacker gets the key (unless the TPM is involved, but
getting *that* right on a standard distro is difficult or impossible).

And I'm not even sure why an attacker who manages to become root wants
your disk encryption key.  That key is worth nothing unless the
attacker makes its attack persistent, but, if the attacker can install
a persistent user-level backdoor, then they can read the cleartext off
your disk just as easily as they can read the ciphertext.

Then split /dev/mem and turn off /dev/port for all locked-down modes.

bpf, in certain contexts, gives you unrestricted access to *reading*
kernel memory.  bpf should, under no circumstances, let you write to
the kernel unless you're using fault injection or similar.

I'm surprised that Alexei acked this patch.  If something like XDP or
bpfilter starts becoming widely used, this patch will require a lot of
reworking to avoid breaking standard distros.
