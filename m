This seems like a weak argument to me.  Sure, this is a bit different
from seccomp(), and maybe shoving it into the seccomp() multiplexer is
awkward, but surely the bpf() multiplexer is even less applicable.

But I think that you have more in common with seccomp() than you're
giving it credit for.  With seccomp, you need to either prevent
ptrace() of any more-privileged task or you need to filter to make
sure you can't trace a more privileged program.  With landlock, you
need exactly the same thing.  You have basically the same no_new_privs
considerations, etc.

Also, looking forward, I think you're going to want a bunch of the
stuff that's under consideration as new seccomp features.  Tycho is
working on a "user notifier" feature for seccomp where, in addition to
accepting, rejecting, or kicking to ptrace, you can send a message to
the creator of the filter and wait for a reply.  I think that Landlock
will want exactly the same feature.

In other words, it really seems to be that you should extend seccomp()
with the ability to attach filters to things that aren't syscall
entry, e.g. file open.

I would also seriously consider doing a scaled-back Landlock variant
first, with the intent of getting the main mechanism into the kernel.
In particular, there are two big sources of complexity in Landlock.
You need to deal with the API for managing bpf programs that filter
various actions beyond just syscall entry, and you need to deal with
giving those filters a way to deal with inodes, paths, etc.  But you
can do the former without the latter.  For example, you could start
with some Landlock-style filters on things that have nothing to do
with files.  For example, you could allow a filter for connecting to
an abstract-namespace unix socket.  Or you could have a hook for
file_receive.  (You couldn't meaningfully filter based on the *path*
of the fd being received without adding all the path infrastructure,
but you could fitler on the *type* of the fd being received.)  Both of
these add new sandboxing abilities that don't currently exist.  In
particular, you can't write a seccomp rule that prevents receiving an
fd using recvmsg() right now unless you block cmsg entirely.  And you
can't write a filter that allows connecting to unix sockets by path
without allowing abstract namespace sockets either.

If you split up Landlock like this then, once you got all the
installation and management of filters down, you could submit patches
to add all the path stuff and deal with that review separately.

What do you all think?
