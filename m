Which isn't the point. The access control isn't on the watchpoint,
it's on delivering the event to the watchpoint. The access control
needs to be based on the process that created the event and the
process receiving the event.

In both cases you have one process sending information
to another. If you use killpg() instead of kill() you can
send to a number of processes without knowing them individually.
A process can chose what to do with (most) signals, including
ignore them.

I'm looking at this from a security model viewpoint. If process
A sends information to process B that's a write operation with
A as the subject and B as the object.

Hey, I'm not the one saying that containers don't need/want kernel
manifestation. Of course you may have troubles with access consistency
if you go around changing the access control attributes with namespaces.
One of the problems with signals is that you can't chmod() your process
to allow signals from other specified users. If you don't design an
access control scheme into the watchpoint mechanism you aren't going to
be able to deal with situations like this.
