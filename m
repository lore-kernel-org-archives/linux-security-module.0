This increases the unease from my side ... it looks like there is no way
to fully understand if a field is really used or not, without having
deep intimate knowledge of lots of code that is only marginally involved :-/

Similarly, how would I be able to specify what would be the correct way
to decide the member of the union to use for handling the field?

If there were either some sort of non-multiplexed tag/cookie field or a
function, that would specify how to treat the various unions, then it
would be easier to multiplex the remaining data, according to how the
page is used.
