Whoops, yes.

I don't particularly disagree with any of this, but you seem to be
saying "if you've bought into the party line wrt signed modules, you
had better enable lockdown, too".  I *don't* buy into the party line
about why signed modules should be needed for Secure Boot.

Give me a break.  There's a *huge* difference between a system where
only root can load unsigned modules and a system where anyone can load
unsigned modules.

Any root process can read /dev/mapper/plaintext_disk, lockdown or otherwise.

Sure.  I have no problem with having an upstream kernel have a
lockdown feature, although I think that feature should distinguish
between reads and writes.  But I don't think the upstream kernel
should apply a patch that ties any of this to Secure Boot without a
genuine technical reason why it makes sense.
