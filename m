Yikes, good catch, thanks!

True, though this is slightly different from people putting their
big_keys on NFS, I guess (but who would do such a thing anyway?).

Meh, it's a rewrite, so sure, it's long. I saw a bunch of bugs and
rewrote the whole thing rather than going one-by-one with the bugs,
which would have produced a series. Personally I'd prefer to keep it
like this than spending the time needling away with git and extra
commit messages and struggling to make them each build separately.
Seems like very very little gain for the time required to do that
right. *shrug* Will wait to hear from David.

Yea that's fair. I'm mostly just running around like a headless
chicken after seeing ECB and wondering how this got committed in the
first place, but nobody really takes chickens seriously. But yes, I
suppose one way of considering this is just to say, "big_keys did not
use encryption before 4.14, even though the code was really
complicated."

I imagine the conflicts will be moving back from get_random_bytes_wait
to get_random_bytes and maybe the loff_t/kernel_{read,write} thing. Is
this what you had in mind too? I should be able to handle those fairly
easily and send it to Greg manually after this lands.

Thanks again for the review, very appreciated.

Jason
