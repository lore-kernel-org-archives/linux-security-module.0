It might be worth looking through the last several years of kernel
CVEs to find all the ones that would have been stopped with a feature
like this. There are many examples lately: both DCCP (CVE-2017-6074)
and n_hldc (CVE-2017-2636) come to mind this year alone.

Typo: complements

Perhaps mention why this is a complement (i.e. modules_disable is ALL
modules, and modautorestrict is just auto-loaded, not explicitly
loaded).

Typo: relax

I wonder if this should just be named
/proc/sys/kernel/modules_autoload (to look more like
modules_disabled)?

If we can't settle on a way to do this, perhaps this LSM should just
live in the core kernel, similar to modules_disabled? We do already
have the hooks to implement it with an LSM, but I'd hate to block this
feature just because we can't solve task_struct sharing.

Maybe add a new bit like no_new_privs? (Though I guess you'd need 2
bits, so maybe a full field like no_new_privs used to be.)

Another TODO item could be to add output to /proc/$pid/status as done
for seccomp and no_new_privs? Though perhaps only if this is a core
kernel change...

I'd love to see this restriction added; I'm sick of adding stuff to
modprobe.d blacklist files after-the-fact...
