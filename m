Subject: [PATCH 06/24] kexec_load: Disable at runtime if the kernel is
	locked down

From: Matthew Garrett <mjg59@srcf.ucam.org>

The kexec_load() syscall permits the loading and execution of arbitrary
code in ring 0, which is something that lock-down is meant to prevent. It
makes sense to disable kexec_load() in this situation.

This does not affect kexec_file_load() syscall which can check for a
signature on the image to be booted.
