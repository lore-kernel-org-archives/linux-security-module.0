Yes, this matches how we understood your comments:  
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260311081955.GS12611@unreal/

In the end, the goal is to build something practical and avoid adding
unnecessary complexity that brings no real benefit to users.

The issue is that the sentence below was the reason we did not merge v1 with v2:
https://github.com/LinuxSecurityModule/kernel/blob/main/README.md#new-lsm-hooks
"pass through implementations, such as the BPF LSM, are not eligible for
LSM hook reference implementations."

We are not limited to LSM solution, the goal is to intercept commands
which are submitted to the FW and "security" bucket sounded right to us.
