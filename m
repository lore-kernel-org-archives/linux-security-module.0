In the patch that shows how to secure the selinux initialized state,
there is a static _ro_after_init handle (the 'file' in your example), 
which is immutable, after init has completed.
It is as immutable as any const data that is not optimized away.

That is what the code uses to refer to the pmalloc data.

Since the reference is static, I expect the code will use it through 
some offset, which will be in the code segment, which is also read-only, 
as much as the rest.

Where is the writable pointer in this scenario?

Gadgets can be removed by inlining the function calls.

Dave Hansen suggested I could do COW and replace the old page with the 
new one. I could implement that, if it is preferable, although I think 
it would be less efficient, for small writes, but it would not leave the 
current page mapped as writable, so there is certainly value in it.
