My point is quite simple:
my_deviceA_init() {
        err = request_firmware(&fw, "deviceA"); <--- (a)
        if (err)
                goto err_request;

        err = verify_firmware(fw);  <--- (b)
        if (err)
                goto err_verify;

        load_fw_to_deviceA(fw);     <--- (c)
        ...
}

As legacy device drivers does not have (b), there is no chance to
prevent loading a firmware@(c) for locked-down kernel.

If you allow me to bring in yet another function, say
request_firmware_signable(), which should be used in place of (a)
for all verification-aware drivers, that would be fine.
In this case, all the invocation of request_firmware() in legacy code
could be forced to fail in locked-down kernel.

But I think that "signable" should be allowed to be combined with other
features of request_firmware variants like _(no)wait or _direct.
