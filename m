Ok so you are likely referring to http://lkml.org/lkml/2017/6/23/551 ,
thanks.  I had actually read that differently when you sent it, and
thought it was more to do with the suggestion of putting the nsid
tags in the middle of the xattr name versus putting it on the end.
As far as that is concerned, note that no other tags besides uid=
are currently supported, and only security.capability is being
namespaced.

Well, that's not the intent here.  The goal is *not* to make one fs image
that satisfies 200k possible uid mappings.  The goal is to reconcile the
support for an unprivileged user to set uid agnostic (within the
container) file capabilities with the uid namespace's design goals -
namely root in a container is privileged over the container but
completely unprivileged wrt the host.

This is in part why in my previous version I only allowed a single
namespaced fscap.  But I don't think that we have to enforce a
single fscap - I think it's fair to tell users "go ahead and shoot
yourself in the foot" performance-wise, if they insist on doing
this.

The goal of now putting the root kuid in the name is not to support
multiple containers, but to have common code supporting
security.capability and security.ima, and maybe a few more.

This I have no idea on.  Stefan, have you looked at this?

Well it is a whole new approach and whole new patch, so of course that's
to be expected :(
