No, it has nothing to do with other users wanting it. ?It has to do
with extending an API to support detach signatures.

There's no reason to define a new function named
kernel_read_file_from_path_signed(). ?To prevent code duplication, the
existing functions would turn into wrappers. ?It's not like there are
that many users. ?A quick search returned:

kernel_read_file_from_fd: ?2
kernel_read_file_from_path: 5
LSMs: 3 loadpin, selinux, + ima
