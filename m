Which is the sudo case and why sudo uses a separate pty/tty pair as it's
not just TIOCSTI that's an issue but there are a load of ioctls that do
things like cause signals to the process or are just annoying -
vhangup(), changing the speed etc

(And for console changing the keymap - which is a nasty one)

I would submit that creating a new pty/tty pair is the proper answer for
that case however. Making the tty calls respect namespaces is however
still a no-brainer IMHO.
