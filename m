In terms of PTYs, this patch does not try to prevent writes to a slave
device (which afaik is what /dev/tty will give you). It tries to prevent the
equivalent of writes to the master device. As far as I know, there is no
way to go from a slave to the corresponding master without having
access to the master in some other way already.
