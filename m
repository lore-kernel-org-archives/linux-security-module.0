The problem is that each filesystem has a function that collects the 
xattr names. These functions only return the needed size if size==0 and 
don't write anything into a buffer. If the buffer is empty or there is 
no buffer, I have nothing to remap and calculate size for. So I pass a 
buffer large enough to hold the xattr names to the filesystem functions 
so I can then subsequently walk the xattrs and remap them. The remapping 
only needs to be done in non-init_user_ns since there the uid parts 
(@uid=1000) may need to be rewritten and most importantly, the size of 
the needed buffer can increase, depending on how the uid mappings are.

I don't want to extend every filesystem's xattr name gathering function...
