WARN() is for recoverable kernel bugs, which this is, so WARN() is correct here.
Fuzzers often find cases where WARN() is used on invalid user input or other
cases that are not kernel bugs, and then it has to be removed or replaced with
pr_warn().  But here it is appropriate.  Unfortunately a lot of developers still
seem confused; improving the comments in include/asm-generic/bug.h might help.
