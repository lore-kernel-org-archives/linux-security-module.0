fstat() and then open *assuming* I have permissions.

If I am the attacker wanting to type something into your su when you go
and su from my account, or where the user account is trojanned I do the
following

fork
exit parent
child ptraces the shell (same uid as it's not setuid)

You type "su" return
The modified shell opens a new pty/tty pair and runs su over it
My ptrace hooks watch the pty/tty traffic until you go to the loo
My ptrace hooks switch the console 
My ptrace hooks type lots of stuff and hack your machine while eating the
output

and you come back, do stuff and then exit

And if you are in X it's even easier and I don't even need to care about
sessions or anything. X has no mechanism to sanely fix the problem, but
Wayland does.

Fortunately in any sane container case we don't give X11 handles to the
container contents. In insane cases (flatpak for example) you lose.

For the case where the goal is to stop something leaking out of a
container then I agree entirely - namespaces can be used to play
whackamole with that particular one or you could use a pty/tty pair which
is how "sudo" solves the same problem space.

Disabling TIOCSTI via some magic Kconfig is silly, but making it
namespace hard is not.

If you really care about container security you could just a lightweight
vm instead but that's a different discussion ;-)
