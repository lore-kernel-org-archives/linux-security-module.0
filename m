So in these two cases, if the kernel was built w/o modules, and HDLC
and DCCP was built-in, you'd be screwed, then?

Is the goal here to protect people using distro kernels which build
the world as modules, including dodgy pieces of kernel code that are
bug-ridden?

If so, then presumably 90% of the problem you've cited can be done by
creating a script which takes a look of the modules that are normally
in use once the machine is in production, and then deleting everything
else?  Correct?

And yes, this will potentially break some users, but the security
folks who are advocating for the more aggressive version of this
change seem to be OK with breaking users, so they can do this without
making kernel changes.  Good luck getting Red Hat and SuSE to accept
such a change, though....
