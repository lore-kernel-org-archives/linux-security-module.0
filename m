I really don't understand why you need a new function.??The
request_firmware() eventually calls kernel_read_file_from_path(),
which already calls the pre and post LSM hooks.

IMA-appraisal is already on these hooks verifying the requested
firmware's signature. ?For systems with "lockdown" enabled, but
without IMA-appraisal enabled, define a small, builtin LSM that sits
on these LSM hooks and denies the unsigned firmware requests.
