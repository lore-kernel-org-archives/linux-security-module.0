This is a very good point, and this is actually feedback that was
given (by Alan Cox, iirc) the last time this series was circulated.

This series is a mixed bag of patches that all look like they improve
'security' in one way or the other. But what is lacking is a coherent
view on the threat model, and to what extent all these patches reduce
the vulnerability to such threats. Without that, these patches do very
little beyond giving a false sense of security, imo.
