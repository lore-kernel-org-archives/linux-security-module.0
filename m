I think so. If we want IMA to own the format, we might want to go further than
just changing the word "module" in the marker. We might consider having more
flexibility and some additional fields, for example multiple signatures, or certificate
chains, ascii/binary encodings etc. We could maybe add a different type for CMS
Signed-Data.
