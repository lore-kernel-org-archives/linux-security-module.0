Not really.

If you pass me your console for example I can mmap your framebuffer and
spy on you all day. Or I could reprogram your fonts, your keyboard, your
video mode, or use set and paste selection to write stuff. If you are
using X and you can't get tty handles right you'll no doubt pass me a
copy of your X file descriptor in which case I own your display, your
keyboard and your mouse and I don't need to use TIOCSTI there either.

There are so many different attacks based upon that screwup that the
kernel cannot defend against them. You aren't exactly reducing the impact.
