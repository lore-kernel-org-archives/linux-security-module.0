While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I would really like
to see a mechanism for managing all of the blobs as being
potentially shared rather than just the task blob. With
infrastructure blob management being the general case we
could stack any set of existing modules that does not
include both SELinux and Smack. (AppArmor is threatening
to join that set, but we're still waiting on that) I
think it's a bad idea to go ahead with one implementation
for task blobs without taking care of the others.
