I still cannot wrap my head around why providing users with a
protection is a bad thing. Yes, the other tty games are bad, but this
fixes a specific and especially bad case that is easy to kill. It's
got a Kconfig and a sysctl. It's not on by default. This protects the
common case of privileged ttys that aren't attached to consoles, etc,
so while the framebuffer thing is an issue, it's not always an issue,
etc.

I'd like to hear Greg's thoughts on this series...
