First off, thank you for the clear and rational responses - newbie
status in these upstreaming/kernel matters has a bit of a steep
learning curve.
I would however, have to disagree with the above in that there is a
very large number of purpose built Linux systems in play, home routers
being a good example, which effectively retain the same security
posture over their lifetime in an increasingly hostile operating
environment. Mitigation at every tier of the attack cycle is desirable
as a  (configurable) default such as to at least reduce the impact of
compromise (they may leak memory containing the admin cred  for the
web ui via some protocol error, but dont get shells, local privs, and
raw device access). Then there are all the servers out there which
would benefit from this, as they dont use those components but do
expose TTYs to dangerous consumers, and even the workstations in a
similar boat where they dont depend on faulty consumers but are
operated by faulty users. Devil's in the details right? Ideally, if
properly designed with input from greybeards, faults can be mostly
nullified and edge cases addressed with adjacent maintainers.

Wouldn't dream of taking that bet - the vast majority of Linux users
dont even know they're Linux users :). Disagree with the latter part
though, the majority of people rely on the appropriate organs of
society (military, police, security-focused devs) to provide for their
safety; they not only take for granted but largely abide by the
constraints placed by those in the know such as to ensure that safety.
A cynical example being that you may not know exactly what the stuff
in that hazmat-labled container will do to you (may make you into
Wolverine, or melt your bones), but you're not likely to open it and
take a sip - you trust the people who sealed it to know enough of the
details to have made that decision. Implementing changes like this
(properly scoped and implemented, as the refinement process seems to
be doing) makes a lot of sense top-down as it forces consumers to do
things the right way instead of waiting for them before adopting a
useful function.

Back to the newbie status bit, i've read and heard (in varying degrees
of satisfaction and frustration) that upstream makes it hard to adopt
significant changes as a culture. Obviously there are practical
concerns around compatibility, but there must be some avenue to have a
clear and rational discussion with Olympus about inducing a well
planned and short period of churn to affect changes which will greatly
extend the iconic notion of systems running stable and safe for years
at a time...
In practical terms, distributions ship tons of patches for kernel bugs
faster than you can reload a blunderbuss. While that is good practice,
and should continue, it results in constant operating efforts on the
parts of the consumer having to "manage their updates" since the bug
isn't restricted in access vectors or efficacy by a global defensive
measure, but requires direct patching to mitigate. Compliance beholden
systems, which tend to be in the critical path, suffer obligatory
burdens from the status quo - find me a hospital IT security manager
who hasn't thought of running (himself or his boss) head first through
his office window since the start of the quarter, and i'll betcha he
started work Friday.
A "security clamp-down" would be great if it were well coordinated
with the ecosystem such as to have bugs found by compile-time
approaches immediately addressed by their owning maintainers, quickly
spread use of read-only and randomized structures, memory allocations,
or whatever other defenses are implemented at the core/LSM
infrastructure tiers. Once the large changes are in, things go back to
business-as-usual, but without the ops engineers being restricted to
eating with dull plastic spoons.

Understood and agreed - getting the right scope and constraints for
the job is imperative for proper design and implementation of the
solution. As i'm reading the evolution of this thread i'm learning how
submissions evolve to fit the needs defined by members. Sort of rare
to see a process involving multiple participants these days which
hasn't devolved into a sandy goat-roping procedure.

Here i again, have to respectfully disagree. Waiting on "significant
interest" to patch their workstations and servers is what got a chunk
of the world looking for backups and coughing up bitcoins recently. If
there is a viable threat model, it should be addressed proactively, as
opposed to potential operating bugs which are shaken out in the course
of ops (which is how i understand current triage to work for bugs -
once its found, not potentially because conditions could create it).
Security as an afterthought can be seen as a form of complacency, and
as we've all read - "complacency kills."
