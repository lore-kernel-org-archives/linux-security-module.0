There's a spectrum across "insane not to be done everywhere"
(STRICT_KERNEL_RWX), "this is a good idea for nearly all Linux
systems" (link restrictions), "this can break some common use-cases,
but protects systems without that use-case" (user-namespace
disabling), "this breaks most systems, but specialized deployments
really need it" (modules_disabled).

There's also a difference between immutable CONFIG options that cannot
be disabled at runtime, those that can, global sysctls, per-namespace
controls, etc etc. The kernel is all about providing admins with knobs
to tweak their performance and security. Suddenly being told that we
can't create optional improvements is very odd.

Now, being told "make it easier to audit all the module loading we're
already doing so we can further reduce needless exposures for everyone
even without this feature enabled", THAT makes sense. My point there
is that we've already done those kinds of things; see commits like:

  7f78e0351394 ("fs: Limit sys_mount to only request filesystem modules.")
  5d26a105b5a7 ("crypto: prefix module autoloading with "crypto-"")
  4943ba16bbc2 ("crypto: include crypto- module prefix in template")

I don't want to break users either. I want to provide meaningful ways
for admins to reduce their kernel attack surface. Djalal and I aren't
advocating for on-by-default removal of module auto-loading (that
would have been a very small patch!). The idea was to provide a
dynamic control over it, and make that available to distros. As shown
in the patch series, it would be immediately put to use with systemd
for process-tree isolation and for container restriction.

I don't think this is sloppy and of course distros would see use,
since systemd would be using it.

This isn't about giant-hammer CONFIGs -- this is like more like
PR_SET_DUMPABLE or seccomp.
