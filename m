I thought mount name space should be considered too even
though I wasn't considering the cloning of file handles
into a user mount name space.

But can this happen in other ways besides user mount name
space creation (I'm fishing here)?

And nsenter(1) doesn't require an exec for anything other
than a pid name space change so a forced close on exec
wouldn't be enough. Or am I mistaken in that nsenter(1)
actually requires running a program (even though the man
page implies it's optional) ...

Are there other consideration my limited understanding is
missing?
