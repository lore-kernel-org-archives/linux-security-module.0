Actually the XFRM framework CVE-2017-7184 [1] is one real example, of
course there are others. The exploit was used on a generic distro
during a security contest that distro is Ubuntu. That distro will
never provide a module autoloading restriction by default to not harm
it's users. Consumers or containers/sandboxes then can run their
confined apps using such facilities.

These bugs will stay in embedded devices that use these generic
distros for ever.

Actually I think they do and we can't just change that. Users may
depend on it, it is a well established facility.

Now the other problem is CAP_NET_ADMIN which does lot of things, it is
more like the CAP_SYS_ADMIN.

This is a quick list that I got from only the past months, I'm pretty
sure there are more:

* DCCP use after free CVE-2017-6074
* n_hldc CVE-2017-2636
* XFRM framework CVE-2017-7184
* L2TPv3 CVE-2016-10200

Most of these need CAP_NET_ADMIN to be autoloaded, however we also
need CAP_NET_ADMIN for other things... therefore it is better to have
an extra facility that could coexist with CAP_NET_ADMIN and other
sandbox features.
