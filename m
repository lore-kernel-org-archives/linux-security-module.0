Alright, I can start by those.

The ones that are in the cover letter, etc may not have the
appropriate context, the request_module_dev() sure can be made since
if you can open you already have the context.

this still leaves all the cases where we don't have the appropriate
context and other implicit loads that are triggered by another
implicit load, etc.

Also the simple local flag is easy to grasp, with real users for it,
and we can abstract on top with load "newfeatures" of course this does
not mean that we should say "we-re insecure by default". I want it to
be more allow newfeatures or not for apps and users... requiring caps
may give users the idea to pass CAP_SYS_MODULE or other caps for
something that used to work, they may start giving it if we break lot
of usecases, and yeh the caps are much broader and do much more
harm...

Ok, so beside updating with request_module_cap() I will investigate
request_module_dev() and we can see

Thanks!
