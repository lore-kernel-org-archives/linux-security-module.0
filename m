Hi David, a few comments:

Doesn't this need 'Cc: <stable@vger.kernel.org>	[v4.9+]',
since the commit it fixes is there?

I guess the 'state' variable is fine, though it makes this patch (which will
need to be backported) a tad larger.  I'd also prefer a bit more information in
the commit message about the problem being solved.  But anyway, there are also
some problems in how READ_ONCE() and memory barriers are used (or not used) in
the new/changed code, and there is one other bug:

This should use 'smp_load_acquire(&key->state) == KEY_IS_INSTANTIATED', since
some ->describe() methods expect to access the payload after this.  Yes, it's no
worse than before, but as long as the line of code is being replaced we might as
well get it right...

Here the key has no more references, so nothing can be changing the state.
Thus, the READ_ONCE() isn't actually needed.

smp_store_release() would make this simpler as well as guarantee that the write
is atomic.

Not too important in practice (as this is constantly gotten wrong all over the
kernel, and compilers play nice enough to make it not a huge deal), but
READ_ONCE(key->state) will guarantee that the read of 'key->state' is atomic and
not e.g. done byte-by-byte.

This is the wrong place for this memory barrier.  The state is checked
separately in ->describe() and it may have changed between when it was shown in
proc_keys_show() vs. when it is checked in ->describe().  We can't actually make
these two access to ->state consistent with respect to each other right now.
The most we can do is use smp_load_acquire() in key_is_instantiated() so that at
least ->describe() isn't broken by itself.  So the change here is pointless.

This should be simply:

	if (!(lflags & KEY_LOOKUP_PARTIAL) && !key_is_instantiated(key))
		goto invalid_key;

smp_load_acquire() rather than READ_ONCE(), in case the caller uses this as an
indication that it is safe to access the payload.

This is backwards; it should be 'if (!key_is_negative(key))'.

'key' is NULL here.  It should be 'key_ref_to_ptr(key_ref)'.


>       KEYS: load key flags and expiry time atomically in keyring_search_iterator()

The commit message refers to both flags and expiry time, but now it only
actually updates how the expiry time is loaded, as the flags were already done
by "KEYS: Fix race between updating and finding a negative key".

>       KEYS: load key flags and expiry time atomically in proc_keys_show()

The commit message refers to negative ('N') but not instantiated ('I') as the
example, but that is no longer a valid example since this patch comes after
"KEYS: Fix race between updating and finding a negative key".
