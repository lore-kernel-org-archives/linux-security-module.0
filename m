Very rarely in my experience. And the one time that we sent a kernel
to updates-testing that was signed with the test key instead of the
real key, we had a surprisingly high number of reports from users that
it was broken before the update even got synched to mirrors.  So we
don't have actual numbers of users running active secure boot with
Fedora, but we do know it is more than we expected.  The majority of
people who do run into issues are those running out of tree modules,
who haven't imported any sort of key for local signing.  This isn't
like SELinux was at launch where it was so invasive that a large
number of users instinctively turned it off with every installation, I
would guess even people who turned it off in the past, don't even
think about it when they get a new machine and leave it on.
