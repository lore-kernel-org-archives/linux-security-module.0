And it still doesn't deal with the fact that there are hundreds of other
ways to annoy the owner of a tty if it's passed to a lower privilege
child from framebuffer reprogramming through keyboard remaps.

The proper way to handle those cases is to create a pty/tty pair and use
that. Your patch is pure snake oil and if anything implies safety that
doesn't exist.

In addition your change to allow it to be used by root in the guest
completely invalidates any protection you have because I can push

"rm -rf /\n"

as root in my namespace and exit

The tty buffers are not flushed across the context change so the shell
you return to gets the input and oh dear....
