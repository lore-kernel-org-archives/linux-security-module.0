This is not true that I'm openly going against what the documentation
instructs. The part of the email chain where I show this got removed
somehow. Again I will refer to the capabilities man page that you
quoted.

 From http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html

"Don't choose CAP_SYS_ADMIN if you can possibly avoid it!
...
The only new features that should be associated with CAP_SYS_ADMIN are
ones that closely match existing uses in that silo."

My feature affects the TIOCSTI ioctl. The TIOCSTI ioctl already falls
under CAP_SYS_ADMIN, therefore I actually *am* following the
documentation.
