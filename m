These patchset are about module auto-loading which is triggered from
multiple paths in the kernel, the cover letter notes all the
differences between the two operations and why the explicit one and
"modules_disabled=1" is already a pain.

The finit_module() is covered directly by CAP_SYS_MODULE, and for
aliasing I am not sure how it will be related or how userspace will
maintain it, we do not have a use case for it, we want a simple flag.

Thank you!
