For the *default* validation approach, agreed that we can LSMify this now through
kernel_read_file() by checking the enum kernel_read_file_id for READING_FIRMWARE,
as you did with your proposed LSM hook fw_lockdown_read_file(), but *iff* we
agree on which mechanisms to support for the default validation approach.

I say support given LSM'ifying this means anyone can end up trying to scheme up
a kernel solution which is non-IMA appraisals. For instance, based on
discussions so far, perhaps a sensible initial *default* scheme to strive for
firmware which we may not get a vendor to sign for us, or for which we don't
have a key to trust for singing could be to use a simple hash of files. This
makes sense for firmware which is typically not updated regularly and for which
we lost a source of updates for.

There's still a similar catch-22 issue here though:

A few folks have argued that we should support custom key requirements
from the start, so we can support a vendor wishing to use their own keys
from the start. Using a specific key is much more efficient for device
drivers which for instance may have firmware updated much more regularly,
this way a hash update on the kernel is not needed per firmware update.
Even if we support both schemes from the start, supporting a "default"
scheme without having any drivers update implies *all* firmware API calls
would need to fit the default policy scheme initially supported. So if
hashes of files is what would be used to start off with we'd be forcing all
firmware API kernel calls to follow that scheme from the start and I don't
think that makes much sense.

Despite some folks not liking it, supporting an initial default scheme just be
to be firmware signed by the linux-firmware maintainer might be an easier first
optional policy to support.

It does not mean we don't have to support hashes from the start, we can,
however that could require a driver change where its hash is specified or
preferred, for instance.

Likewise, for alternative and custom signing requirements, we also can require
a different API call, but for this to work well, I think we'd need a different
firmware API call and an LSM hook other than kernel_read_file_from_path() which
can enable the custom requirements to be specified. Otherwise we run into
similar issue as Takahiro pointed out with verify_firmware(), where the default
policy (say a default key) would not have a match from the start so it would
fail from the start. There is also the technical limitation that
kernel_read_file_from_path() has no way of letting callers pass further
security criteria.
