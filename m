Subject: [PATCH 00/30] security, efi: Add kernel lockdown
Message-ID: <151024863544.28329.2436580122759221600.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk>
To: linux-security-module@vger.kernel.org
List-Id: linux-security-module.vger.kernel.org


Here's a set of patches to institute a "locked-down mode" in the kernel and
to trigger that mode if the kernel is booted in secure-boot mode or through
the command line.

Enabling CONFIG_LOCK_DOWN_KERNEL makes lockdown mode available.

Enabling CONFIG_ALLOW_LOCKDOWN_LIFT_BY_SYSRQ will allow a SysRq combination
to lift the lockdown.  On x86 this is SysRq+x.  The keys must be pressed on
an attached keyboard.

Enabling CONFIG_LOCK_DOWN_IN_EFI_SECURE_BOOT will cause EFI secure boot to
trigger kernel lockdown.

Inside the kernel, kernel_is_locked_down() is used to check if the kernel
is in lockdown mode.

Note that the secure boot mode entry doesn't work if the kernel is booted
from older versions of i386/x86_64 Grub as there's a bug in Grub whereby it
doesn't initialise the boot_params correctly.  The incorrect initialisation
causes sanitize_boot_params() to be triggered, thereby zapping the secure
boot flag determined by the EFI boot wrapper.

A manual page, kernel_lockdown.7, is proposed, to which people will be
directed by messages in dmesg.  This lists the features that are restricted
amongst other things.  [Note: I need to update this to mention IMA, so I'll
reply with that later].

Changes:

 (*) Made /dev/mem and /dev/kmem explicitly unopenable in lockdown mode,
     rather than being unopenable as a side effect of /dev/port being made
     unopenable.

 (*) Added lockdowns for ftrace and kprobes.

 (*) Made the bpf lockdown prohibit the use of sys_bpf entirely.

 (*) Made IMA require secure_boot rules in lockdown mode.

 (*) Made module signing and kexec allow unsigned images if IMA has been
     used to validate the image.
