No one said that they are.

But if you really can't figure it out, I can add:

	openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048

at the front of the PKCS#8 example;-)

I can even change the examples to have the same private key name.

It would probably be done in the kernel rather than keyctl.  If it's done in
userspace, there's no need to do it in keyctl.  The PKCS#8 parser is primarily
a test port - especially as it doesn't need anything like a TPM.

It's of limited real utility, I think, because even if the blob is encrypted
and you can pass the decryption password to the kernel, the password still has
to be present in userspace, however briefly.

It's meant to be stripping off the PEM wrapper and outputting the DER, but see
below.

I lost a bit from the cover note.  It needs "-out -" attaching.

	openssl asn1parse -inform pem -in modulekey1.priv -noout -out - | wc -c
