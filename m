ok, will do

page->private  ?
I thought mapping would not work in the cases you mentioned?

No, the code I have is almost 1:1 what you wrote.
Apart from mapping <=> private

In my previous mail I referred to page->private.

Maybe I was not very clear in what I wrote, but I'm almost 100% aligned
with your snippet.

Yes, it's not even needed in this scenario.
It was just a way to ensure that it would be a value that cannot be come
out accidentally as pointer value, since it is already taken.
