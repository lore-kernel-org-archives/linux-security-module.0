I just take some convincing that's all ;)

I really want it to be more flexible if we are making this into a full
blown LSM. From drivers/tty/tty_ioctl.c I gather the following tty
ioctls:

TCGETA
TCGETS
TCGETS2
TCGETX
TCSETA
TCSETAF
TCSETAW
TCSETS
TCSETS2
TCSETSF
TCSETSF2
TCSETSW
TCSETSW2
TCSETX
TCSETXF
TCSETXW
TIOCGETC
TIOCGETP
TIOCGLCKTRMIOS
TIOCGLTC
TIOCGSOFTCAR
TIOCSETC
TIOCSETN
TIOCSETP
TIOCSLCKTRMIOS
TIOCSLTC
TIOCSSOFTCAR

would it be overkill to have a sysctl kernel.ttyioctlwhitelist.X where X
is one of the ioctls above?

(definitely will work on a better name than ttyioctlwhitelist)

I agree. When you have those kinds of requirements, a MAC is required.
