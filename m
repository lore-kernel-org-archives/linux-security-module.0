Subject: [PATCH v7 0/3] ro protection for dynamic data
Message-ID: <20170626144116.27599-1-igor.stoppa@huawei.com>

Hi,
please consider for inclusion.

This patch introduces the possibility of protecting memory that has
been allocated dynamically.

The memory is managed in pools: when a pool is made R/O, all the memory
that is part of it, will become R/O.

A R/O pool can be destroyed to recover its memory, but it cannot be
turned back into R/W mode.

This is intentional. This feature is meant for data that doesn't need
further modifications, after initialization.

An example is provided, showing how to turn into a boot-time option the
writable state of the security hooks.
Prior to this patch, it was a compile-time option.

This is made possible, thanks to Tetsuo Handa's rework of the hooks
structure (included in the patchset).

Changes since the v6 version:
- complete rewrite, to use the genalloc library
- added sysfs interface for tracking of active pools

The only question still open is if there should be a possibility for
unprotecting a memory pool in other cases than destruction.

The only cases found for this topic are:
- protecting the LSM header structure between creation and insertion of a
  security module that was not built as part of the kernel
  (but the module can protect the headers after it has loaded)

- unloading SELinux from RedHat, if the system has booted, but no policy
  has been loaded yet - this feature is going away, according to Casey.
