My assumption here is:
1) there are some less important and so security-insensitive firmwares,
   by which I mean that such firmwares won't be expected to be signed in
   terms of vulnerability or integrity.
   (I can't give you examples though.)
2) firmware's signature will be presented separately from the firmware
   blob itself. Say, "firmware.bin.p7s" for "firmware.bin"

I don't think that the current security_kernel(_post)_read_file() scheme
fit with this assumption very well.

Thanks,
