Actually, you don't necessarily.  I use this patch:

https://marc.info/?l=tpmdd-devel&m=148392353230117

Which allows me to make a TCP connection to the software TPM running in
userspace without having to have the TPM components in qemu (or even to
run virtual).  I used it to debug all the in-kernel resource manager
patches.  It's TPM 2.0, but could easily be modified to work with 1.2
