This is not what my patch does. Mine is like:

	if (TIOCSTI && !ns_capable(tty->owner_user_ns, CAP_SYS_ADMIN) &&
		magic_flag)

in other words:
	if (TIOCSTI && (different_owner_user_ns || !CAP_SYS_ADMIN) &&
		magic_flag)

can you specify what you mean by different_namespace? which namespace?

The reason I brought in the user namespace was to solve an edge case
with nested containers. capable() will never be true in a container, so
nested containers would break if we didn't do the ns_capable check. This
is also the reason for the addition of owner_user_ns to tty_struct.

The point of my patch is to prevent any type of tiocsti activity where
the tty is given to an unprivileged process/container. The emphasis of
my check is on the CAP_SYS_ADMIN part, not the namespace part.
