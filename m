I would generally prefer an optional CONFIG_LSM_ENABLE to
CONFIG_LSM_DISABLE, but I understand the logic behind your
approach. I would be looking for something like

CONFIG LSM_ENABLE
	string "Default set of enabled LSMs"
	default ""

as opposed to

CONFIG LSM_DISABLE
	string "Default set of disabled LSMs"
	default ""

where an empty string is interpreted as "use 'em all" 
in either case.

I prefer the multi-instance
	lsm.disable=selinux lsm.disable=yama
to the list
	lsm.disable=selinux,yama

but at this point I don't really care all that much.
