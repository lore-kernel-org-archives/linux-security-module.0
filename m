Really? By "pty", are you referring to the master? If so, as far as I know,
to go from the slave to the master, you need one of:

 - ptrace access to a process that already has an FD to the master, via
   ptrace() or so (/proc/$pid/fd/$fd won't work)
 - for a BSD PTY (which AFAIK isn't used much anymore), access to
   /dev/ptyXX

Am I overlooking something?

Why would the child be able to ptrace the shell? AFAICS, in the most
relevant scenarios, the child can't ptrace the shell because the
shell has a different UID (in the case of e.g. su or sudo). In other
scenarios, Yama, if enabled, should still stop you from doing that.
And even with containers that have the same UID as the calling user,
which I think is not exactly a good approach from a security perspective,
the PID namespace should stop you from ptracing things outside the
container.

This is somewhat off-topic, but SAK has several security issues, one of
which is documented in the source code. I would be surprised if anyone
actually relied on that. Comment above __do_SAK():

/*
 * This implements the "Secure Attention Key" ---  the idea is to
 * prevent trojan horses by killing all processes associated with this
 * tty when the user hits the "Secure Attention Key".  Required for
 * super-paranoid applications --- see the Orange Book for more details.
 * [...]
 * Now, if it would be correct ;-/ The current code has a nasty hole -
 * it doesn't catch files in flight. We may send the descriptor to ourselves
 * via AF_UNIX socket, close it and later fetch from socket. FIXME.
 * [...]
