Good catch. You are right and the same holds true for ah_output() in ah4.c.

But I do wonder, the code there now treats -EBUSY as a special case
and returns NET_XMIT_DROP
but if an AEAD or AHASH transformation return some other error, like
-ENOMEM or -EINVAL shouldn't
we return NET_XMIT_DROP in that case too?

Any ideas?
