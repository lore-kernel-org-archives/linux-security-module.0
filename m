Yes, all true, but this long comment doesn't belong here in the middle

With the template format "ima-sig", the verified file signature needs
to be included in the measurement list. ?Based on this file signature,
the attestation server can validate the signature.

In this case, where the appraisal comes first followed by the
measurement, the appraised file signature is included in the
measurement list. ?I don't see the problem here.

Like the clean up you did elsewhere, this new set of tests should be
made into a function. ?The comment could placed along with the new
function.
