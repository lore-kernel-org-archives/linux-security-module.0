Yep, the theoretical GET_FLAGS above would handle this, I think. What
I was wondering about is for TSYNC (or any future flags) which aren't
tracked in the struct seccomp_filter; would the existence of GET_FLAGS
mean we need to remember such flags as well somewhere? Not necessary
for CRIU's correctness right now at least, but...
