Ah, yes, you mentioned this.

And I was planning to follow your advice, using one of the flags.

... there was this further comment, about speeding up the access to
vm_area, which seemed good from performance perspective.

I do not strictly need to modify the page struct, but it seems it might
harm performance, if it is added on the path of hardened usercopy.

I have an updated version of the old proposal:

* put a magic number in the private field, during initialization of
pmalloc pages

* during hardened usercopy verification, when I have to assess if a page
is of pmalloc type, compare the private field against the magic number

* if and only if the private field matches the magic number, then invoke
find_vm_area(), so that the slowness affects only a possibly limited
amount of false positives.
