Well, yes rhashtables can have an overhead especially when reclaiming
memory back, I could not identify a way how to separate tables unless
we use cgroups as an ID. Anyway this of course could be added in
task_struct and updated to work like the capability security hooks
rather than a proper LSM with its own name. But as noted in the other
response, we may need task->security field for Yama anyway. I'm open
to suggestion ? I may try to converge the task->security blob with
what Casey is proposing and see! otherwise fallback to task_struct as
a last resort!

Thanks!
