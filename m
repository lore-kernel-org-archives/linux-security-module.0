It wouldn't, it, if it really were "secure", would not allow any command
line parameters to be changed.  Which is exactly what those bootloaders
who "claim" to be secure do.

And, just to butt in here, there is no requirement that I have ever
heard of from anyone at UEFI or Microsoft that this type of "kernel
feature" is a requirement to allow for a bootloader/kernel to be signed
with their key.  So that should take the "politics" reason off the table
here, if people thought that somehow it was even a viable reason...

thanks,
