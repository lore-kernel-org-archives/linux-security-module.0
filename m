It would be nice to add a label to genalloc.rst and reference it here:

IMHO, "read only" looks better than R/O

Can we use #. instead of numbers for the numbered list items?

Maybe it's better to have a short reference to the function and keep all
the elaborate descriptions in the API section?
For instance, something like
