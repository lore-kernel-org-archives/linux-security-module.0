Right, and I'm fine to help with those general improvements. As I
mentioned in another reply, we've been steadily narrowing the
exposures by keeping request_module() from being exposed to "all
possible modules" in many of the places it's been exposed to
userspace:

  7f78e0351394 ("fs: Limit sys_mount to only request filesystem modules.")
  5d26a105b5a7 ("crypto: prefix module autoloading with "crypto-"")
  4943ba16bbc2 ("crypto: include crypto- module prefix in template")

I don't want you to think this is an area where work hasn't already
been done to try to improve things.

I am totally fine with this. The question I'm hoping to have answered
is, "then what?" We already have concrete examples of module
autoloading that will still be need to stay unprivileged and as-is in
the kernel (even if we remove others). What do you see as the way to
allow an admin to turn those off?
