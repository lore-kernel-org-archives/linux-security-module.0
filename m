Whoa.  Why doesn't lockdown prevent kexec?  Put another away, why
isn't this a problem for people who are fearful that Linux could be
used as part of a Windows boot virus in a Secure UEFI context?

If lockdown simply included a requirement for a signed kernel for
kexec --- and if kernel signing aren't available, to simply not alow
kexec, wouldn't that take care of this case?

This wouldn't even be all that much of a burden for non-distro users
with lockdown enabled, since in my experience outside of enterprise
and data center use cases, kexec isn't used --- and in fact, very
often kexec doesn't even work outside of a very carefully selected and
bug-fixed set of device drivers.  (It often doesn't work in non-distro
kernels because very few upstream developers really care about kexec.)
