There is another option create a security bit.

That could be called SECBIT_CONTAINER.   This turns off functionally
like TIOCSTI that can be used to it break out with.

This case the mainlined code the TIOCSTI currently in CAP_SYS_ADMIN is
a container breaker its designed to allow reaching cross users and
TTYs.   SECBIT is a inverted capability so when it enabled it disables
something and once enabled it cannot be disabled.   So the lxc
addressed to the user TIOCSTI causing a breakout does not work against
the CAP_SYS_ADMIN one.   If there was a security bit that disabled
TIOCSTI completely that prevents all the escape paths by TIOCSTI.

There would also be room for a SECBIT_NO_OBSOLETE what is quite simple
make using obsolete functions application fatal.   Now with CAP_SYSLOG
if SECBIT_NO_OBSOLETE programs using the old capability could find the
feature removed.   So over time we can systematically remove the multi
entry path we have now as userspace updates and stops requiring the
second path.

There is more than 1 way to skin this cat.   There is no need to add
more to CAP_SYS_ADMIN and it particular bad when you consider having
to obey the Linux Rule of user-space compatibly would result in having
apply CAP_SYS_ADMIN to existing applications with Matts patch.
