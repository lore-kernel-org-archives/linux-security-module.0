Subject: [PATCH v3 0/5] Migrate all TPM 2.0 commands to use struct tpm_buf
Message-ID: <20180305165614.5469-1-jarkko.sakkinen@linux.intel.com>
To: linux-security-module@vger.kernel.org
List-Id: linux-security-module.vger.kernel.org

In order to make struct tpm_buf the first class object for constructing TPM
commands, this patch set migrates all TPM 2.0 commands to use it. The next
step after this is to migrate TPM 1.2 commands in a subsequent patch set.
Finally, tpm_transmit_cmd() can take simply struct tpm_buf as its argument
and this interface can be exported to be used by the kernel keyring.

The ultimate goal of this work is to make constructing TPM commands inside
the kernel simple and robust.

v3:
* Fixed error handling in tpm2_get_random()

v2:
* Fixed author information in the commit that fixes the self-test issue,
  removed '\n' from the log message and added the missing tested-by.
  (James: sincere apologies about this)
* Removed the redundant "out of memory" log message from tpm2_shutdown().
* tpm_buf_destroy() was called before using the response data in
  tpm2_probe().
* Added missing tpm_buf_destroy() to tpm2_get_random().
