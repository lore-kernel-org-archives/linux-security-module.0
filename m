Subject: [PATCH v2 0/6] KEYS: fix atomicity issues with key flags
Message-ID: <20170926201105.126166-1-ebiggers3@gmail.com>
To: linux-security-module@vger.kernel.org
List-Id: linux-security-module.vger.kernel.org

From: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>

The first patch in this series fixes the race between updating and
finding a negative key, which could be used by an unprivileged user to
cause a kernel oops.  That patch is Cc'ed to stable.

The remaining patches fix some other, more theoretical atomicity issues
with accessing key->flags and key->expiry, then eliminate
KEY_FLAG_NEGATIVE, which becomes unnecessary after the first patch.

Eric Biggers (6):
  KEYS: fix race between updating and finding negative key
  KEYS: load key flags atomically in key_is_instantiated()
  KEYS: load key flags and expiry time atomically in key_validate()
  KEYS: load key flags and expiry time atomically in
    keyring_search_iterator()
  KEYS: load key flags and expiry time atomically in proc_keys_show()
  KEYS: remove KEY_FLAG_NEGATIVE
