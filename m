It turns out that it's probably not so favorable.
The patch relies on the function vmalloc_to_page ... which will return
NULL when applied to huge mappings, while the original implementation
will still work.

It was found while testing on a configuration with framebuffer.

So it seems unlikely that there is any gain to be had, from this
perspective.

The use of the field still makes sense from the perspective of adding
pmalloc support to hardened usercopy, but there is no more need for the
field to exist as separate patch.

This patch can be simplified and merged with the pmalloc patch.
