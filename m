Having actually read your series more correctly now (oops!), I still
think that this patch should be dropped.  I can see an argument for
having a flag that one can set when adding a seccomp filter that says
"prevent ptrace of any child that doesn't have this exact stack
installed", but I think that could be added later and should not be
part of an initial submission.  For now, Landlock users can block
ptrace() entirely or use PID namespaces.
