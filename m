This example is good, but it raises one question: should the xattr
signature cover the entire contents of the stock distro image (i.e.,
also cover the appended signature), or should it ignore the appended
signature and thus cover the same contents that the appended signature
covers?

If the former, then we can't reuse the iint->ima_hash that was collected
when trying to verify the appended signature because it doesn't cover
the appended signature itself and won't match the hash expected by the
xattr signature.

If the latter, then evmctl ima_sign needs to be modified to check
whether there's an appended signature in the given file and ignore it
when calculating the xattr signature.

Which is better?

Ok, the above is what v2 already does, so the only change I made was to
rename the function from measure_and_appraise to collect_and_appraise to
match the IMA jargon.
