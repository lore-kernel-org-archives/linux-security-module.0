I was wanting clarification on how you viewed events being generated inside
the namespace being seen by an external listener, vs events being generated
outside the namespace being seen by an internal listener.

Hmmm...  OTOH, maybe it's not a problem - can a mount namespace intersect with
two different user namespaces, given it has its own user_ns pointer?

Might not be useful if the watched object doesn't have UID or GID - a
superblock say.

Also, that raises an additional question: if someone triggers an event - say a
mount - there is an additional set of creds (that of the triggering process).
Do I need to consider that?

I thought you might say that.
