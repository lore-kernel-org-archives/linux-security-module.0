Subject: [PATCH 0/3] linux-next: mm: hardening: Track genalloc allocations
Message-ID: <20180429024542.19475-1-igor.stoppa@huawei.com>
To: linux-security-module@vger.kernel.org
List-Id: linux-security-module.vger.kernel.org

This patchset was created as part of an older version of pmalloc, however
it has value per-se, as it hardens the memory management for the generic
allocator genalloc.

Genalloc does not currently track the size of the allocations it hands out.

Either by mistake, or due to an attack, it is possible that more memory
than what was initially allocated is freed, leaving behind dangling
pointers, ready for an use-after-free attack.

With this patch, genalloc becomes capable of tracking the size of each
allocation it has handed out, when it's time to free it.

It can either verify that the size received, when free is invoked, is
correct, or it can decide autonomously how much memory to free, if the
value received for the size parameter is 0.

These patches are proposed for beign merged into linux-next, to verify
that they do not introduce regressions, by comparing the value received
from the callers of the free function with the internal tracking.

Later on, the "size" parameter can be dropped, and each caller can be
adjusted accordingly.
