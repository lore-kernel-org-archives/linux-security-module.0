It was suggested that the feature would only be adopted in niches like
Android and I pointed out that it's not really relevant to Android.

It's a waste of time to try convincing me that it's useful elsewhere. I
never said or implied that it wasn't.

It's cheaper to use an existing system like Android Things where device
makers only need to make their apps and perhaps some userspace hardware
drivers for cases not covered by mainline kernel drivers. I don't think
it makes sense for every device vendor to manage an OS and I seriously
doubt that's how the ecosystem is going to end up as it matures.

I'm not talking about whitelist vs. blacklist, compiling kernels or
anything like that.

Congestion control algorithms are being used as an example in terms of
the mechanism being used to control which are available to unprivileged
users. The obscurity of congestion control algorithms is irrelevant.

There are cases where unprivileged module auto-loading is relied upon
like network protocols. Having configuration for which protocols can be
used by unprivileged users is superior to limiting only which ones can
be auto-loaded. That's why I bought up the existing congestion control
knob. It works well in terms of having a whitelist of the sane, widely
used cases with exposing anything obscure requiring configuration. They
happen to be implemented as modules too.

Killing off unprivileged module loading other than a few cases like that
makes sense, and then those can provide similar control with similarly
sane defaults.
