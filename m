In general, I don't see anything wrong with wanting to let gen_pool_free
not take a size. It's hard to say anything more without a patch to review.
My biggest concern would be keeping existing behavior and managing two
bitmaps locklessly.

This looks to be an intentional choice, presumably so regions can be
added in atomic contexts. Again, if you have a specific patch or
proposal this would be easier to review.
