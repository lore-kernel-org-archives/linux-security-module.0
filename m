That would be cleaner, yes. As I said, it looks correct to me, but I
would simply prefer to keep the code as simple as possible. If there
is a good reason for the additional fast path, then I have no
objections at all.

Ah ok. That does complicate matters, indeed.

That makes sense, but deserves another big fat warning when it turns
out that the blacklist contains an entry we cannot verify against.
