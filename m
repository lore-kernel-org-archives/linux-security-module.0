open() what? As far as I know, for System-V PTYs, there is no path you can
open() that will give you the PTY master. Am I missing something?

I think the "When using a program like su or sudo" in the patch description
refers to the usecase where you go from a more privileged context (e.g. a
root shell) to a less privileged one (e.g. a shell as a service-specific
account used to run a daemon), not the other way around.

[However, I do think that it's a nice side effect of this patch that it will
prevent a malicious program from directly injecting something like an
SSH command into my shell in a sufficiently hardened environment
(with LSM restrictions that prevent the malicious program from opening
SSH keyfiles or executing another program that can do that). Although
you could argue that in such a case, the LSM should be taking care of
blocking TIOCSTI.]
