Just to be clear, module loading requires - and must always continue to
require - CAP_SYS_MODULE against the initial user namespace.  Containers
in user namespaces do not have that.

I don't believe anyone has ever claimed that containers which are not in
a user namespace are in any way secure.

(And as for the other claim, I'd prefer to stick to "VMs are in most
cases as insecure as properly configured containers" :)
