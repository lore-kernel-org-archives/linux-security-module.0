Hello David,

By itself, this series looks in reasonable shape to me. But I do have
a few remaining concerns, apologies if it includes issues that I could
have brought up earlier.

- The series conflates 'UEFI secure boot support' with 'kernel lock
down support'. I think this has been brought up before, but I really
think we should have a cleaner separation between the feature (locking
down various bits of the kernel if lockdown is in effect) from the
policy 'enable lockdown if UEFI secure boot is enabled'. The latter
does not need to be configurable at all: on any UEFI system, we could
detect whether UEFI secure boot is in effect and report it. The only
tunable we need is in the lockdown context, whether lockdown needs to
take effect automatically when UEFI secure boot is detected (but there
could be other ways to enable lockdown, including a kernel cmdline
param or a sysfs node). Similarly, whether lockdown can be lifted or
not has *nothing* to do with whether it was enabled due to UEFI secure
boot, so I don't see the point of having
CONFIG_EFI_ALLOW_SECURE_BOOT_EXIT at all.

- The current series enables lockdown, but does not lock anything
down. Even if the code is in good shape otherwise, I am reluctant to
ack and/or merge anything right now, given that it provides a false
sense of security. This also ties in to my more general concerns with
this code (and I am aware I never replied to your email explaining it,
my apologies [again]): without any sense of how large the attack
surface is now, and how much we reduced it by implementing the items
on your list above, we should really not be making claims of security,
given that we really have no idea how much more secure we are. That
said, I do subscribe to the effort, in the sense that moving towards
the goal is strictly better than moving away from it, or not at all.

- Patch 5/5 breaks the build on non-x86. Please build test EFI-related
patches on arm64 and/or ARM before submitting patches. And if
possible, could we find a magic SysRq key that works on all
architectures? I know we discussed this at some point (I think?) but I
don't remember the conclusion.

Regards,
Ard.
