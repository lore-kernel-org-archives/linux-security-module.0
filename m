The patches does not change default and make it easy for users and we
have request for this, not all world is Red Hat / SuSE , I build
embedded Linux for clients when I manage to have some, and I clearly
would have set this to my clients since most of them won't be able to
afford all the signing and complexity, now how I should allow modules
load/unload replace with newer versions, but restrict some of their
apps from triggering it, "modules_disabled=1" is not practical. I
can't build a perfect version for every usecase,  and they started to
ship apps for IoT, even containers for IoT, yes they do it and they
use the same os for various use cases! so it is not about those, even
embedded vendors have one single shared layer that they use for all
their products.

For distros, the target is also containers and sandboxes, and they are
already interested in it.

P.S. please the cover letter already mentions that this is for Embedded and IoT.
