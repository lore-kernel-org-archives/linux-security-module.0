That is effectively what i'm suggesting - as a form of protection for
consumers against direct reads of data which may have been corrupted
by some irrelevant means. In the context of pmalloc, it would probably
be a separate type of ro+verified pool which consumers would
explicitly opt into. Say there's a maintenance cycle on a <name some
scary thing controlled by Linux> and it wants to make sure that the
instructions it read in are what they should have been before running
them, those consumers might well take the penalty if it keeps <said
scary big thing> from doing <the thing we're scared of it doing>.
If such a resolver could be implemented in a manner which doesnt break
all the things (including acceptable performance for at least a
significant number of workloads), it might be useful as a general tool
for handing out memory to userspace, even in rw, as it provides
execution context in which other requirements can be forcibly
resolved, preventing unauthorized access to pages the consumer
shouldn't get in a very generic way. Spectre comes to mind as a
potential class of issues to be addressed this way, since speculative
load could be prevented if the resolution were to fail.
