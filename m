Right.

Seccomp policy could refuse TIOCSTI to any fd, but that's not ideal.  It could
be customized per-application-start to only refuse TIOCSTI to the passed-in tty
fd, but you'd have to prevent dup then right?  Selinux can label the fd so it's
in fact ideal here.  But - is there something clever a seccomp policy could do
to work only on specified fds and any that were dup'ed?

Mind you, I of course agree that creating a new pty and passing only that in
is the sane fix.  Maybe in the end this thread will serve best as a loud
reminder / teaching moment about this issue for those about to write such an
application.
