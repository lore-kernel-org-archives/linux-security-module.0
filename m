Really?  Every time I have tried to actually follow up on this
statement, it turns into an urban myth.  If you have proof of this,
please let me know, otherwise I am going to keep saying it is false.

Unsubstantiated fear of relying on another company's signing key to
suddenly stop working is worrying.  But it's just that, fear, and not
anything that is actually true.  We have a working shim binary that is
signed, in use by all distros and other operating systems (community and
corporate).  To revoke that key now would be insane on a variety of
levels.

So let's stop playing the myth and fear card people, and focus on the
actual facts here.

Again, no fear please, facts only.
