I trust or distrust a system as a whole.  I don't make that decision
by comparing it to anything.  I make it by evaluating how the system
works and deciding whether it's trustworthy.

Secure boot serves several purposes:

1. Anti-competitive purposes.  It's intentionally difficult to run
non-Windows OSes on Windows ARM machines, for example.

2. Allowing me to use a stock UEFI machine to have a verified boot chain.

The latter has nothing whatsoever to do with CPL0.  The former,
however, does.  If I could easily write some Windows program to run
CPL0 code, then I could chainload Linux using the Windows image, and
I've subverted the purpose.

Cynical?  Yes.

This is, IMO, a silly argument.  You're saying that some bad guy has
managed to run code as root on my laptop.  Then, next week, the bad
guy steals my laptop while it's powered off, and Lockdown is supposed
to protect me against that bad guy.  If this happens, I've already
lost completely, lockdown or no.
