Sure, thanks! I'll include more details for any later versions. This
is mainly related to some internal refactoring the LSM is doing to
support additional LSM that need more extensive "stacking" of the
kernel internals. I aimed this at linux-doc@ and linux-arch@ to get
feedback on the Documentation/ and linker script changes,
respectively. In theory, users don't need to know anything about
minor/major nor blob-sharing, as that should normally be all an
internal issue.

Thanks!
