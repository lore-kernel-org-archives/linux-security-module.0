The only reason this is off by default is kernel rule No 1. Most of new security features are off or WARN_ON because of it otherwise bad things happen on mailinglists :) .

It seems to me that you demand an impossible job here. Don't break userspace and don't disable by default. It can't happen due to years of technical debt. I mean everyone prefers default-on but we can choose best alternative instead of maintaining status quo.

Userspace can be configured in a way which is compatible with those changes being on the same as it can be configured to work with selinux. That means on distro level or sysadmin level it's a valuable tool. It's better than nothing and it's better than using some out-of-tree patches instead. Switching one sysctl would make their life easier.

There is demand for kernel hardening stuff and default-off behavior is good compromise between breaking changes and nothing at all. The kernel has very diverse users group with different needs and capabilities so there is no one size fits all. Targeting all of them will often end in nothing useful to anyone.

Yours sincerely
