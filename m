'struct fscrypt_key' isn't really useful because it doesn't have any reserved
fields.  So if we wanted to change the format we'd have to change the key
description anyway, by setting some flag in the fscrypt_policy and the
fscrypt_context that indicates a different key description should be used.

And fscrypt does verify the key's size before it uses it already.  Sure, it
might to nice to verify it at add_key() time, but I don't think it's necessary.

That would work, but we don't actually need the fscrypt_key structure at all.
Just declare 'const u8 *raw' and 'u32 size' local variables and set them
appropriately, then pass those into derive_key_aes() (changing its prototype)
rather than the fscrypt_key.

Not really, that patch series ("fscrypt: filesystem-level keyring and v2 policy
support") is still in RFC status, so we don't know which would be merged first.
I'm still looking for people with the interest and expertise to review it :-)

That being said, we could choose to support the "encrypted" key type using only
FS_IOC_ADD_ENCRYPTION_KEY, rather than the current mechanism of
process-subscribed keyrings.  (With FS_IOC_ADD_ENCRYPTION_KEY, we'd need to use
a flag in 'struct fscrypt_add_key_args' to indicate that the key should be found
by searching the current process's keyrings for an "encrypted" key with the
given description, rather than taking the key directly from the ioctl argument.)
But it wouldn't be a huge deal to support it both ways.
