Hi Amir,

I was liking the prefix at first, but I'm actually not sure it's worth
it.  THe main advantage would be so that checking for namespace or other
tags could be done always at the same offset simplifying the parser.
But since we will want to only handle namespacing for some tags, and
potentially differently for each task, it won't actually be simpler, I
don't think.

On the other hand we do want to make sure that the syntax we use is
generally usable, so I think simply specifying that >1 tags can each
be separate by '@' should suffice.  So for now we'd only have

	security.capability at uid=100000

soon we'd hopefully have

	security.ima at uid=100000

and eventually trusted.blarb at foo=bar
