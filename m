So i don't think we want to waste a page flag on this. The struct 
page flags field is already full AFAIK (see page-flags-layout.h)

Moreover there is easier way to tag such page. So my understanding
is that pmalloc() is always suppose to be in vmalloc area. From
the look of it all you do is check that there is a valid page behind
the vmalloc vaddr and you check for the PG_malloc flag of that page.

Why do you need to check the PG_malloc flag for the page ? Isn't the
fact that there is a page behind the vmalloc vaddr enough ? If not
enough wouldn't checking the pte flags of the page enough ? ie if
the page is read only inside vmalloc than it would be for sure some
pmalloc area.

Other way to distinguish between regular vmalloc and pmalloc can be
to carveout a region of vmalloc for pmalloc purpose. Issue is that
it might be hard to find right size for such carveout.

Yet another way is to use some of the free struct page fields ie
when a page is allocated for vmalloc i think most of struct page
fields are unuse (mapping, index, lru, ...). It would be better
to use those rather than adding a page flag.


Everything else looks good to me, thought i am unsure on how much
useful such feature is but i am not familiar too much with security
side of thing.
