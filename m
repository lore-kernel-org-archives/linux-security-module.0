In other words you are not actually fixing anything.

Which is not necessarily the namespace of the process that next issues a
read().

This is snake oil. There is a correct and proper process for this use
case. That proper process is to create a new pty/tty pair. There are two
cases

- processes that do it right in which case the attacker is screwed and we
  don't need to mess up TIOCSTI handling for no reason.

- processes that do it wrong. If they do it wrong then they'll also use
  all the other holes and attacks available via the same path which are
  completely unfixable without making your system basically unusable.


So can we please apply the minimum of common sense reasoning to this and
drop the patch.
