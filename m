I didn't do that because then I would need to pass func as an argument
to ima_read_modsig just to print the warning above. But it does simplify
the code so it may be worth it. I'll make that change in v4.

Indeed, that is wrong. I'm still a bit fuzzy about how EVM works and how
it interacts with IMA. The only way I can think of singling out modsig
without reintroduced the complex expression you didn't like in v2 is as
below. What do you think?

So even for the IMA xattr sig case, the evm_verifyxattr call in
ima_appraise_measurement is an optimization and can be skipped?

In that case, patch 6/7 "ima: Store measurement after appraisal" isn't
enough and we have to go back to v2's change in ima_main.c which ties
together the collect and appraise steps in process_measurement (In that
version I called the function measure_and_appraise but it should be
called collect_and_appraise instead). That is because if the modsig
verification fails, the hash needs to be recalculated for the xattr
signature verification.

Either that, or I add another call to ima_collect_measurement inside
ima_appraise_measurement if the modsig verification fails. Which do you
prefer?

I used recursion to avoid duplicating two blocks of code: the logic in
the "if (rc <= 0)" block which needs to be done again when verifying the
xattr sig, and also the logic of interpreting the return value of
evm_verifyxattr which I also thought needed to be done again, but you
seem to be saying that is just an optimization and can be skipped.
