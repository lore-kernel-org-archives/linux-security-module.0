Short answer: right.

Long answer: The kernel runs all the registered parsers until all fail 
or one of them recognizes the format.  All the currently supported 
asymmetric key formats are DER based, e.g. PKCS8, PKCS7, TPM-1.2, etc. 
All these have a very specific DER structure with the TPM-1.2 being the 
simplest format.
