I don't quite get it.  Change notification is just that: a
notification.   You need to know what object that notification relates
to, to be able to retrieve the up to date attributes of said object.

What happens if you get a change counter N in the notification
message, then get a change counter N + 1 in the attribute retrieval?
You know that another change happened, and you haven't yet processed
the notification yet.  So when the notification with N + 1 comes in,
you can optimize away the attribute retrieve.

Nice optimization, but it's optimizing a race condition, and I don't
think that's warranted.  I don't see any other use for the change
counter in the notification message.

What is it useful for?

If the notification itself would contain the list of updated
attributes and their new values, then yes, this would make sense.  If
the notification just tells us that the object was modified, but not
the modifications themselves, then I don't see how the change counter
in itself could add any information (other than optimizing the race
condition above).
