Subject: [PATCH 4/7] fscrypt: fix dereference of NULL user_key_payload
In-Reply-To: <20170928212602.41744-1-ebiggers3@gmail.com>

When an fscrypt-encrypted file is opened, we request the file's master
key from the keyrings service as a logon key, then access its payload.
However, a revoked key has a NULL payload, and we failed to check for
this.  request_key() *does* skip revoked keys, but there is still a
window where the key can be revoked before we acquire its semaphore.

Fix it by checking for a NULL payload, treating it like a key which was
already revoked at the time it was requested.
