This patch solves a real problem when userspace does things wrong. For
those that do not want it, a sysctl exists (and is even default off).
Arguments about how userspace needs to be fixed is a total red
herring. Like symlink protections before, this should be available for
those that want it because it solves an interface problem that gets
regularly misused and causes real damage. The kernel has a
responsibility to protect userspace.

As Daniel mentions, there is a history of mistakes that appear to be
becoming even more common:
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=TIOCSTI

There are people who want this feature that do not care about xemacs
breaking. The default cannot be enabled because of the golden rule of
never breaking userspace, but entirely refusing to fix a regularly
misused feature is wrong-headed. We must accept that not only are bug
lifetimes long, but that bugs will keep getting reintroduced. When
there is a chance to kill a class of bugs or exploit techniques, it's
the kernel responsibility to do so. This is a clear case of that, and
the solution is concise.

If there is some better solution that the kernel can provide to
mitigate processes misusing ttys, then by all means, we can add that
too, but has nothing to do with refusing this change. This solves a
specific problem that in many cases is the only path to privilege
escalation (as Daniel mentioned). Refusing this change is nonsense.
"Your car shouldn't have seat belts because maybe something will stab
you through the windshield" isn't a reasonable argument to make.
