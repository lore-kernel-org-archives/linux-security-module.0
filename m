Thanks for the heads up, I suppose PTRACE_SECCOMP_GET_FLAGS similar to
how PTRACE_SECCOMP_GET_FILTER works will be fine for this. One
question is: would we then also need to keep track of the TSYNC flag?
I don't think CRIU needs this to be correct, and we can grab the
KILL_PROCESS flag from filter->kill_process, so perhaps it's moot.

Anyway, happy to do this and the userspace part when this lands.

Cheers,

Tycho
