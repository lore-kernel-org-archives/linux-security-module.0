Subject: [PATCH v3 2/4] seccomp: Add SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_KILL_PROCESS
In-Reply-To: <1502305317-85052-1-git-send-email-keescook@chromium.org>
References: <1502305317-85052-1-git-send-email-keescook@chromium.org>
Message-ID: <1502305317-85052-3-git-send-email-keescook@chromium.org>

Right now, SECCOMP_RET_KILL kills the current thread. There have been
a few requests for RET_KILL to kill the entire process (the thread
group), but since seccomp's u32 return values are ABI, and ordered by
lowest value, with RET_KILL as 0, there isn't a trivial way to provide
an even smaller value that would mean the more restrictive action of
killing the thread group.

Changing the definition of SECCOMP_RET_KILL to mean "kill process" and
then adding a new higher definition of SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD isn't
possible since there are already userspace programs depending on the
kill-thread behavior.

Instead, create a simulated SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS action which
has the semantics of such a return had it been possible to create
it naturally. This is done by adding a filter flag that indicates
that a RET_KILL from this filter must kill the process rather
than the thread. This can be set (and not cleared) via the new
SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_KILL_PROCESS flag.

Pros:
 - the logic for the filter action is contained in the filter.
 - userspace can detect support for the feature since earlier kernels
   will reject the new flag.
 - can be distinguished from "normal" RET_KILL in the same filter
   chain (in case a program wants to choose to kill thread or process).
Cons:
 - depends on adding an assignment to the seccomp_run_filters() loop
   (previous patch).
 - adds logic to the seccomp_run_filters() loop (though it is a single
   unlikely test for zero, so the cycle count change isn't measurable).

Alternatives to this approach with pros/cons:

- Change userspace API to use an s32 for BPF return value, and use a
  negative value to indicate SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS.
  Pros:
   - no change needed to seccomp_run_filters() loop.
   - the logic for the filter action is contained in the filter.
   - can be distinguished from "normal" RET_KILL in the same filter
     chain (in case a program wants to choose to kill thread or process).
  Cons:
   - there isn't a trivial way for userspace to detect if the kernel
     supports the feature (earlier kernels will silently ignore the
     new value, only kill the thread).
   - need to teach libseccomp about new details, extensive updates
     to documentation, and hope there is not confusion about signedness
     in existing userspace.

- Use a new test during seccomp_run_filters() that treats the RET_DATA
  mask of a RET_KILL action as special. If a new bit is set in the data,
  then treat the return value as -1 (lower than 0).
  Pros:
   - the logic for the filter action is contained in the filter.
   - can be distinguished from "normal" RET_KILL in the same filter
     chain (in case a program wants to choose to kill thread or process).
  Cons:
   - adds more than a single unlikely test to time-sensitive
     seccomp_run_filters() loop.
   - there isn't a trivial way for userspace to detect if the kernel
     supports the feature (earlier kernels will silently ignore the
     RET_DATA and only kill the thread).
   - Violates the "most recent RET_DATA" return value used for all
     other actions (since processing must continue to find the first
     RET_KILL with the flag set).
   - May create problems for existing programs that were using RET_DATA
     to distinguish between various SECCOMP_RET_KILL locations.

- Have SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_KILL_PROCESS attach to the seccomp struct
  rather than the filter.
  Pros:
   - no change needed to seccomp_run_filters() loop.
   - userspace can detect support for the feature since earlier kernels
     will reject the new flag.
  Cons:
   - does not provide a way for a set of filters to distinguish
     between wanting to kill a thread or a process.
   - the logic for the filter action isn't contained in the filter,
     which may lead to synchronization bugs (e.g. vs TSYNC, vs CRIU, etc).
