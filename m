Putting the check in key_validate() would make lookups with KEY_LOOKUP_PARTIAL
stop returning negative keys, which would break keyctl_describe(),
keyctl_chown(), keyctl_setperm(), keyctl_set_timeout(), keyctl_get_security() on
negative keys.  I presume those are supposed to work?

Another solution would be to remove the special case from lookup_user_key()
where it can return a negative/revoked/invalidated/expired key if
KEY_LOOKUP_PARTIAL is not specified and the 'perm' mask is 0.  The only callers
it would affect are the case in question here which is clearly a bug, and the
root-only exceptions for keyctl_invalidate() and keyctl_clear().  And I suspect
the latter two are unintentional as well.  (Is root *supposed* to be able to
invalidate a negative/revoked/invalidated/expired key, or clear a
revoked/invalidated/expired keyring?)
