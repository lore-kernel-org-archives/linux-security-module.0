What do you mean by completeness? Please, never add unused stuff.

Change Log only to the cover letter.

This commit is just deadly wrong in so many ways.

I would suggest to make extend always just take crypto ID in so you
don't have to add these bizarre conversion functions.

This probably covers all the patches but just "unsigned int" as type
for parameters and local variables.

I think I'll pass rest of the patches for now because just reviewing the
two first took too much time and wait for an updated version.
