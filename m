This goes along with the question if there were an other users who wanted it,
or more importantly -- if firmware signing was desirable for any reason, a
modified kernel_read_file_from_path_signed() could in turn be used, *or* an LSM
added to handle READING_FIRMWARE and READING_FIRMWARE_PREALLOC_BUFFER.  The
above use case was one example outside of the typical firmware use.  I've long
pointed out that we no longer use the firmware API for just firmware, and the
above is now a very good example of it. I've been suggesting uses of the
firmware API for non-firmware had already happened and that more uses were on
its way. Trusted boot has nothing to do with these uses as such the gains of
systems pegged with "trusted boot" have nothing to do validation of these files
through hardware.

In this particular case its simply easier to re-use the existing redistribution
mechanisms in place already so that users can get the regulatory.db and
regulatory.db.p7s.

So here is now an example  use of request_firmware() API  with its own key
validation / keyring solution completely open coded.

So, given the wireless regulatory use case *does* benefit from re-using
request_firmware() due to the file redistribution aspects, using a new
kernel_read_file_from_path_signed() for non-firmware with the same
/lib/firmware/ path specified would be rather sloppy and awkward.  The right
way to not open code this is to consider adding firmware signing support
properly.

I'll let Johannes chime in, if he so wishes.
