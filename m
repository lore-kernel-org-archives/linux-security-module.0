Yes, it's very confusing, and I wish the names were clearer, or that there was
one macro that just did the right thing (but then the power-of-2 optimization
could only be done for constants, where it might not be necessary anyway).
roundup_pow2() would still be confused with roundup_pow_of_two(), unfortunately.
