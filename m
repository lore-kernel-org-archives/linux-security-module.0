Subject: [PATCH v6 00/19] simplify crypto wait for async op
Message-ID: <1503324309-13673-1-git-send-email-gilad@benyossef.com>
To: linux-security-module@vger.kernel.org
List-Id: linux-security-module.vger.kernel.org

Many users of kernel async. crypto services have a pattern of
starting an async. crypto op and than using a completion
to wait for it to end.

This patch set simplifies this common use case in two ways:

First, by separating the return codes of the case where a
request is queued to a backlog due to the provider being
busy (-EBUSY) from the case the request has failed due
to the provider being busy and backlogging is not enabled
(-EAGAIN).

Next, this change is than built on to create a generic API
to wait for a async. crypto operation to complete.

The end result is a smaller code base and an API that is
easier to use and more difficult to get wrong.

The patch set was boot tested on x86_64 and arm64 which
at the very least tests the crypto users via testmgr and
tcrypt but I do note that I do not have access to some
of the HW whose drivers are modified nor do I claim I was
able to test all of the corner cases.

The patch set is based upon linux-next release tagged
next-20170817.

Changes from v5:
- Remove redundant new line as spotted by Jonathan
  Cameron.
- Reworded dm-verity change commit message to better
  clarify potential issue averted by change as
  pointed out by Mikulas Patocka.

Changes from v4:
- Rebase on top of latest algif changes from Stephan
  Mueller.
- Fix typo in ccp patch title.

Changes from v3:
- Instead of changing the return code to indicate
  backlog queueing, change the return code to indicate
  transient busy state, as suggested by Herbert Xu.

Changes from v2:
- Patch title changed from "introduce crypto wait for
  async op" to better reflect the current state.
- Rebase on top of latest linux-next.
- Add a new return code of -EIOCBQUEUED for backlog
  queueing, as suggested by Herbert Xu.
- Transform more users to the new API.
- Update the drbg change to account for new init as
  indicated by Stephan Muller.

Changes from v1:
- Address review comments from Eric Biggers.
- Separated out bug fixes of existing code and rebase
  on top of that patch set.
- Rename 'ecr' to 'wait' in fscrypto code.
- Split patch introducing the new API from the change
  moving over the algif code which it originated from
  to the new API.
- Inline crypto_wait_req().
- Some code indentation fixes.
