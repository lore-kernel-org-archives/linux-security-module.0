Like Casey, I had confused this patch with the other(?) that resulted
in dropped type checking. This just switches from named list_heads to
indexed list_heads, which is fine now that the BUG_ON exists to
sanity-check the index being used.

It's unlikely that smalloc will allow unsealing after initialization,
so the SELinux disabling case will remain, IIUC.

Can this be unsplit so the [...] remains next to security_hook_heads?

Otherwise, yeah, I can be convinced to take this. :) Thanks for
persisting with this, I think it makes sense now.
