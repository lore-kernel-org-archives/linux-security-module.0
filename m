Not 100% NAK but this does not have "universal logic" embedded into it"

"Distro's use it" is popularity opinion, which has no place over here.
Mastodon, Threads etc. work for that so much better.

Perhaps if the motivation-stimuli-solution type of logics gets carved
crystal clear we can move forward. I.e. you need to work on this. I've
given my feedback for this version, and it is not good enough, sorry.
