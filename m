If lockdown introspection is desired, perhaps just add a /proc file
that lists them all? And if memory usage is a concern, it could be
behind another config, like CONFIG_LOCK_DOWN_KERNEL_PROC ?

I personally don't think the introspection is needed, but I see Ard's point.

I'd like the kernel to grow a bright line between userspace and
physical memory, so I'm a fan of this series. It does look rather
ad-hoc currently, but I think that's the reality the kernel faces.
Right now, we're in a position where the kernel APIs don't provide a
mechanism to distinguish between userspace users and kernel users (in
that anything can just expose a kernel API to userspace: e.g. all the
drivers over the years that trip over STRICT_DEVMEM and then create
their own /dev/mem without restrictions).

So, as we stand, we need to start by adding lockdown checks everywhere
we find exposures, and I'd expect this list to grow over time (which
would support the desirability of introspection, but I kind of see
introspection as overkill). It'd be nice if we could identify classes
of things that have to keep getting lockdown logic added to so that we
could collect them into a single place (e.g. module parameters that
define a phyiscal memory area could use a helper to do it instead of
being yet another unsigned long, and the helper would do the lockdown
check, etc). But that work will take time.

Yeah, splitting policy makes sense to me: Chrome OS would use lockdown
as well, but it doesn't use EFI at all.

(And please CC me on future versions.)
