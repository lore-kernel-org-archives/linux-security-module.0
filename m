Did you see Serge's proposed solution? I want us to not be talking past
each other. Serge proposed the following:

| By default, nothing changes - you can use those on your own tty, need
| CAP_SYS_ADMIN against init_user_ns otherwise.
|
| Introduce a new CAP_TTY_PRIVILEGED.
|
| When may_push_chars is removed from the whitelist, you lose the
| ability to use TIOCSTI on a tty - even your own - if you do not have
| CAP_TTY_PRIVILEGED against the tty's user_ns.

The question is how do you add/remove something from this whitelist? I
assume by add/remove we don't mean that you have to recompile your
kernel to change the whitelist!

you earlier said you wanted the check to look like this:

| if (!whitelisted(ioctl) && different_namespace && magic_flag)

I want to know which namespace you are talking about here. Did you mean
user_namespace? (the namespace I added tracking for in the tty_struct)
