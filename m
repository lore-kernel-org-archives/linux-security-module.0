Subject: [PATCH 00/24] Kernel lockdown
Message-ID: <149141219387.31282.6648284836568938717.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk>
To: linux-security-module@vger.kernel.org
List-Id: linux-security-module.vger.kernel.org


These patches provide a facility by which a variety of avenues by which
userspace can feasibly modify the running kernel image can be locked down.
These include:

 (*) No unsigned modules and no modules for which can't validate the
     signature.

 (*) No use of ioperm(), iopl() and no writing to /dev/port.

 (*) No writing to /dev/mem or /dev/kmem.

 (*) No hibernation.

 (*) Restrict PCI BAR access.

 (*) Restrict MSR access.

 (*) No kexec_load().

 (*) Certain ACPI restrictions.

 (*) Restrict debugfs interface to ASUS WMI.

The lock-down can be configured to be triggered by the EFI secure boot
status, provided the shim isn't insecure.  The lock-down can be lifted by
typing SysRq+x on a keyboard attached to the system.


The patches can be found here also:

They are dependent on the hwparam branch, which I posted separately.
