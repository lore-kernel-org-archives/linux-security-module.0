This is why Shim has support for its own key database, as well as allowing
you to disable further signature validation. If the hardware supports third
party code at all, you can just use Shim to sidestep any unreasonable
restrictions the vendor has imposed.

(This doesn't help with systems that don't support third party code at all,
but this patchset does nothing to make that worse - that hardware wouldn't
boot your own kernel before this patchset, and it won't afterwards either)
