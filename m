so do your best.  The whole lockdown patchset is a best-effort thing,
not a "we did it and it's done" thing.

So turn it off in both modes.  /dev/mem is basically obsolete anyway.
Or restrict it to actual memory, or whatever.

Incorrect.  Linus is rejecting the idea that secure boot implies
lockdown.  I strongly agree with him.  I also think that trying to
make security decisions in a kexeced kernel based on whether the
previous kernel was secure booted is a bad idea, so I'm suggesting a
new feature.  I don't really care what value is passed in
boot_params::secure_boot for a kexeced kernel, but I think it should
not be used for lockdown.

So I stand by my proposal.

Really?  If that is, in fact, true, then turn *that* feature off when
LOCKDOWN_PROTECT_INTEGRITY is set.

As Linus noted, that's because a lot of users who care have already
turned off secure boot.  Once this whole thing gets sorted out, the
hackish dependence of lockdown and secure boot can go away, so it's
time to think about making lockdown less annoying.

You keep making claims like this with no justification whatsoever.

No.

What I meant was some channel that the bootloader can use to securely
communicate options to the running kernel.  The concept of "secure"
here is obviously debatable.  Something in boot_params would work.
Some specially namespaced command line option could work.  Some whole
new "authenticated data from bootloader" block could work.

No.  That has been rejected over and over in this thread.  I'm
proposing an alternative here.

How about setting it unconditionally to false?

_INTEGRITY means "make a best effort to keep root from writing kernel
memory, talking directly to non-IOMMU-protected devices, writing MSRs,
or otherwise corrupting state".  _INTEGRITY_AND_SECRECY means "do all
that and also make a best effort to keep root from reading kernel
memory".
