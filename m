In cifs we attempt to match new mounts to existing tree connections
(instances of connections to a \\server\share) from other mount(s)
based first on whether security settings match (e.g. are both
Kerberos) and then on whether encryption is on/off and whether this is
a snapshot mount (smb3 previous versions feature).  If neither is
mounted with a snaphsot and the encryption settings match then
we will use the same tree id to talk with the server as the other
mounts use.  Interesting idea to allow mount to force a new
tree id.

What was the NFS mount option you were talking about?
Looking at the nfs man page the only one that looked similar
was "nosharecache"

Yes - it is an interesting question.
