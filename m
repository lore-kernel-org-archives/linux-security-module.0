This seems unnecessarily complicated.  Why not handle it like this:

 - Double the bitmap in size (as you have done) but
 - The first half of the bits are unchanged from the existing implementation
 - The second half of the bits are used for determining the length

On allocation, you look for a sufficiently-large string of 0 bits in
the first-half.  When you find it, you set all of them to 1, and set one
bit in the second-half to indicate where the tail of the allocation is
(you might actually want to use an rbtree or something to handle this ...
using all these bits seems pretty inefficient).
