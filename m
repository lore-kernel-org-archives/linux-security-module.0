Something I've been doing recently is building tests in both userspace and
kernel space.  Here's an example:
http://git.infradead.org/users/willy/linux-dax.git/commitdiff/717f2aa1d4040f65966bb9dab64035962576b0f9

Essentially, tools/ contains a reasonably good set of functions which
emulate kernel functions.  So you write your test suite as a kernel module
and then build it in userspace as well.

You misread my proposal.  I did not suggest storing the 'start', but the
'end'.

This would be a bug in the allocator implementation.  Obviously it has to
maintain the integrity of its own data structures.

I think you're making a mistake by basing the pmalloc allocator on
genalloc.  The page_frag allocator seems like a much better place to
start than genalloc.  It has a significantly lower overhead and is
much more suited to the kind of probably-identical-lifespan that the
pmalloc API is going to persuade its users to have.
