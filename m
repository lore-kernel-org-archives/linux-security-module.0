Thanks for explaining the ratio behind this API.

At first I thought this API wanted to take over the existing one, hence
my attempt of making it more generic and re-use it.
But I understand now this was not the goal.

I will stick to the classic crypto API then.

Best Regards,


p.s. I am curious about any use case you may have in mind for encrypting
more than 4GB in one go, as there are no users doing that right now.
