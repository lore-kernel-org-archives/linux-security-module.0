Yes they are complicated even for developers, and normal users do not
understand them, however yes every sandbox and container is exposing
them to endusers directly, they are documented!  so yes CAP_SYS_MODULE
is exposed but it does not cover autoloading.

However, we are trying hard to abstract some semantics that are easy
to grasp, we are mutating capabilities and seccomp to have an
abstracted "yes/no" options for our endusers.

Now, if you are referring to kernel code, the networking subsystem is
using them and I don't want to break any assumption here. There is
still the request_module(), the request_module_cap() was suggested so
networking code later won't have to do the checks on its own, and
maybe it can be consistent in the long term. The phonet sockets even
needs CAP_SYS_ADMIN...

Alright, but I guess we are stuck, is there something better on how we
can do this or describe this ?


Please note in these patches, the mode is specifically described as:

* allowed: for backward compatibility  (I would have done without it)
* privileged: which includes capabilities (backward compatibility too)
or we can add what ever in the future
* disabled: even for privileged.

So I would have preferred if it is something like "yes/no" but...
However in userspace we will try hard to hide this complexity and the
capability bits.

Now I can see that the code comments and doc refer to privileged with
capabilities a lot, where we can maybe update that doc and code to
less state that privileged means capabilities ? Suggestions ?

Thanks!
