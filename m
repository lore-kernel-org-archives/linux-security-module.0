There's lot of out-of-tree drivers too that distributions. I'm not
finding anything usefel in this argument.

I have not seen actual uses of CONFIG_STATIC_USERMODEHELPER_PATH. You
could probably use it with busybox?

I doubt there's a huge demand other than NixOS. Just basing this on that
no other noise have been made so far.

I don't frankly care how NixOS works per se in details. Scope this into
message to problem that it addresses.
