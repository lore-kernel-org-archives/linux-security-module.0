I think that calling the option to make a separate instance
"limit_pids" is extremely counterintuitive.

My strong preference would be to make proc *always* make a separate
instance (unless it's a bind mount) and to make it work.  If that
means fudging stat() output, so be it.

Failing that, let's come up with some coherent way to make this work.
"new_instance" or similar would do.  Then make limit_pid cause an
error unless new_instance is also set.
