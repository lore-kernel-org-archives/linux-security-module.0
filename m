Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Add support for architecture-specific IMA policies
Message-ID: <20180725233200.761-1-erichte@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
To: linux-security-module@vger.kernel.org
List-Id: linux-security-module.vger.kernel.org

IMA can measure and appraise kernel images, but requires the appropriate
policy to be set to do so. This patch set adds the ability for different
architectures to define their own arch-specific default policies to be
loaded at run-time by implementing the arch_ima_get_policy() function.
This allows for the policy to be loaded based on the current system state,
such as secure boot state.

Included is an example patch that loads a set of IMA appraise rules
requiring the kexec kernel images to be measured and signed when EFI secure
boot is enabled. 

This set also contains a patch to IMA that adds a separate appraise func=
specifically for the kexec_load syscall. IMA cannot appraise images loaded
with kexec_load, and therefore automatically fails the signature check --
effectively disabling the syscall when the appropriate appraise rule is
set. This allows for the kexec_load syscall to be "disabled" via IMA
policy, but not conflict with the existing kexec_file_load signature
verification.
