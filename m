ok, this is all new stuff to me ... I suppose I should do it also for
all the other new files I create

But what is the license for the documentation? It's not code, so GPL
seems wrong. Creative commons?

I just noticed a patch for checkpatch.pl about SPDX and asked the same
question there.

I'll move it to the Use section.

I will add a reference to the selftest file.
In practice it can also work as example.

ok, the example route should be more explicative.
