In theory, it's good idea, but in practice it's not as easy to implement as I
think you think.

Let me list here the things that currently get restricted by lockdown:

 (1) Manipulation of devices to access the kernel image:

	- Ioports & ioperm
	- /dev/ports
	- /dev/mem
	- PCI Bar
	- Some debugfs files
	- pcmcia_cis
	- Driver hardware parameters
	  - ISA drivers
	  - TIOCSSERIAL
	  - SCSI EATA driver
	- testmmiotrace
	- firmware

 (2) Direct kernel memory modification:

	- /dev/mem
	- /dev/kmem
	- bpf
	- kprobes

 (3) Direct kernel memory reading:

	- /dev/mem
	- /dev/kmem
	- /dev/kcore
	- bpf
	- kprobes
	- perf

 (4) Indirect kernel access:

	- Modules
	- MSRs
	- Suspend to disk
	- ACPI (custom_method, RSDP, table override, error injection)

 (5) Kexec.

Note that /dev/mem can be used to access MMIO devices (I'm not sure about
/dev/kmem, though).  Even reads through /dev/mem can do this.  I'm not sure
whether that's sufficient to actually affect a modification, though.

Debugfs is particularly icky.  It contains at least a couple of thousand
files, a few of which provide direct access to hardware, some of which change
driver behaviour and some of which just give information.  Auditing that pile
isn't something I really want to have to do.  I'd rather just turn the whole
lot off, but got persuaded otherwise by people who have been using it to
provide mechanisms that programs rely on - hence the only allow files that
have 0444 (and even that is iffy as some of these files have side effects and
write ops anyway).

Note that on x86 we already have an allocated flag for passing the secure boot
flag from kexec/bootloader to the kernel being booted, and what you're
proposing ought to be redundant.  See boot_params::secure_boot.

Uh, no.  bpf, for example, can be used to modify kernel memory.  I think only
the following are safe from being able to talk directly to devices:

	/dev/kmem (O_RDONLY only)
	/dev/kcore
	perf
	some debugfs files

*shrug* Distros have been running with the full set for a while.  I haven't
seen many complaints.

If your key needs to be truly protected, it should never be seen unencrypted
in userspace, rather it should be decrypted in the TPM and then retained in
kernel memory only.

By turning secure boot off, maybe?

Authenticated how?  How do you stop the running system from passing this to
the bootloader next time it is run?  I guess you're thinking of a bootloader
"command" that can only be passed by someone sat at a keyboard and never read
from the config file.

We already have that with secure boot.

This I shall grant you - but you have to be able to prevent an attacker inside
the system from making use of it.  There's a SysRq provided to drop out of
lockdown mode - in theory only usable if you're sat at a wired keyboard
connected to the computer.

Except that they're not.  The boot_params flag must be set to something by
kexec on x86 for transfer along the chain.  However, we can leave secure boot
out for now - that can be treated as a separate issue.

Note that whether you like it or not, distribution kernels already work this
way and propagate the boot_params flag over kexec.

You haven't really defined well what's allowed in _INTEGRITY mode verses
_SECRECY mode.

I'm currently in the throes of modifying my patchset to make it more inline
with what Linus mandates: dropping the enablement from secure boot; dropping
the propagation of the flag over kexec; providing a config option to make it
mandatory.  There is already a command line option to trigger it.
