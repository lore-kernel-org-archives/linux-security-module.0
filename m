Below is a simple example on my laptop of the same inode with
different path names. ?In this case, a list of pathnames would be
double the number of inodes. ?I'm not sure from a performance
perspective if this really matters, or if doing string compares
matters. ?We're not talking about thousands or even hundreds of files,
though this is on the LSM bprm check hook.

The question is really from a security perspective which is better?
?Obviously, as v2 of the patch set changed from using pathnames to
inodes, it's pretty clear that I think inodes would be better. ?Kees,
Serge, Casey any comments?
