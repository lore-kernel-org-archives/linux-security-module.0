No worries, If you weren't at LCA, you wouldn't have known :P

Yeah, that's kinda what I figured. I'm guessing that I treat a pool
just like a normal heap allocation, but then when all the objects I
need to allocate are fully initialised, then I write protect the
pool? i.e. the API isn't using an object-based protection scope?

FWIW, I'm not wanting to use it to replace static variables. All the
structures are dynamically allocated right now, and get assigned to
other dynamically allocated pointers. I'd likely split the current
structures into a "ro after init" structure and rw structure, so
how does the "__ro_after_init" attribute work in that case? Is it
something like this?

struct xfs_mount {
	struct xfs_mount_ro{
		.......
	} *ro __ro_after_init;
	......

Also, what compile time checks are in place to catch writes to
ro structure members? Is sparse going to be able to check this sort
of thing, like is does with endian-specific variables?

I'll look at it in more depth when it comes past again. :P

Cheers,

Dave.
