Subject: [RFC v5 PATCH 0/4] NOT FOR MERGE - ro protection for dynamic data 
Message-ID: <20170606182453.32688-1-igor.stoppa@huawei.com>
To: linux-security-module@vger.kernel.org

This patchset introduces the possibility of protecting memory that has
been allocated dynamically.

The memory is managed in pools: when a pool is made R/O, all the memory
that is part of it, will become R/O.

A R/O pool can be destroyed to recover its memory, but it cannot be
turned back into R/W mode.

This is intentional. This feature is meant for data that doesn't need
further modifications, after initialization.

An example is provided, showing how to turn into a boot-time option the
writable state of the security hooks.
Prior to this patch, it was a compile-time option.

This is made possible, thanks to Tetsuo Handa's rework of the hooks
structure (included in the patchset).

Since the previous version, I have applied fixes for all the issues
discovered that had a clear resolution:

- %p -> pK
- make the feature depend on ARCH_HAS_SET_MEMORY
- fix the range of the page scanning for hardened user copy
- fixed pointer checking for NULL dereferencing


And a couple of issues I found myself:
- return NULL in case someone asks memory from a locked pool
- turn the "protected" flag into atomic type


Still open (at least I didn't get the impression there was a closure):
- need for specific __PMALLOC_ALIGNED ?
- is it really needed to unprotect a pool?
  can't it wait for the implementation of write-seldom?
