I saw several companies who ship their embedded devices with
single-function LSM modules (e.g. restrict only mount operation and
ptrace operation). What is unfortunate is that their LSM modules had
never been proposed for upstream, and thus bugs remained unnoticed.

They cannot afford enabling SELinux or SMACK or TOMOYO or AppArmor
in their products, whereas LSM community tends to think as whether
SELinux or SMACK or TOMOYO or AppArmor can do what they want.

It will become possible to get single-function LSM modules merged if we
stop saying "you can do it with SELinux or SMACK or TOMOYO or AppArmor".
But there is the other barrier if we think about distributions.

If distributors enable all LSM modules which are wanted by their users
(e.g. Ubuntu, or LSM modules dedicated for their embedded devices), there
is no need to support LKM-based LSM modules.

But otherwise (e.g. https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=542986 ),
we are forcing users to rebuild distribution kernels even if the LSM code is
available in vanilla kernels. It is a sort of enforcing CONFIG_MODULES=n.
Offering users the ability to use LSM modules as LKM and allowing users to
use LSM modules which are not enabled by distributors as LKM at user's own
risk is a realistic choice, and therefore I developed AKARI.

The location we are directing to via read-only LSM hooks seems to be: let's
accept source code of LSM modules which they want (so that LKM-based LSM
modules won't be needed), but let's prevent users from running binary code
of LSM modules which they want (by forcing users to rebuild their kernels
via lack of ability to use LKM-based LSM modules). My customers cannot afford
enabling SELinux, but my customers cannot rebuild their kernels because
rebuilding makes it even more difficult to get help from support centers.
Therefore, my customers remain unable to use LSM modules which they want.
This is really unfortunate for me.
