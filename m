If process A does something that sends information to process B
it doesn't matter whether it's explicit (e.g. kill) or implicit
(e.g. exit), you need to have control over the delivery. I can
send Morse code to a listener of mount watchpoints using the
mechanism described. If I'm not supposed to be sending information
to that other user (for whatever reason) that's bad.

It doesn't matter whether it's intentional. It's information flow.

The VFS doesn't do things on it's own. It isn't a subject. It's a
hunk of code that does what it's told *by processes*.

You need access to file entry in /proc. That's my point,
there has to be some mechanism for control. The watchpoint
mechanism proposed offers no way to do chmod 600 on events
that a process can generate.

The proposed mechanism offers no way for a process to say
"I don't want events about what I do sent to Ian" or for
SELinux to say "Don't send this event to processes marked
unconfined_t. They're all a bunch of squares".

OK, that's good. :)

Let me propose a model that shouldn't be too hard to implement
and that is somewhat consistent with existing Linux policies.

When an event is generated the current cred is included in the
message. A filter type is supported that uses the cred information.
The default value for this filter (or if it is absent) is to
deny access to everyone except the owner of the watching process,
just like signals. A process with CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE (or similar),
can change the filter to accept events from other users. The filter
code includes a call

	rc = security_watchpoint_event(struct cred *sender);

so that security modules can decide if the sender is allowed to
write the event to this watcher.

If we want event generators to be in control of who sees what they're
doing it's a bit more complicated. You'll have to add the access
information to the cred so that it gets passed along to the filtering
code. You could pass it in addition to the cred if that's cleaner.
In that case the filter is hard coded and gets the permission from
the sender.

Neither of these should be especially difficult to implement or explain.
