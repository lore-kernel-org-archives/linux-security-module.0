This sounds incorrect to me.  Choosing a fresh, random, one-time-use
256-bit key and rolling with a zero nonce is a totally legitimate way
of using GCM. There's no possible reuse of the key stream this way.
However, on the off chance that you know what you're talking about,
could you outline the cryptographic attack you have in mind, or if
that's too difficult, simply link to the relevant paper on eprint?
