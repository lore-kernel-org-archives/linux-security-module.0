I have merged my TPE LSM with Mimi Zohar's shebang LSM and will be
releasing a version 3 soon. I have also added securityfs support to
shebang that will allow users to update the interpreter list at run
time. This allows for user's to configure TPE/Shebang without any
xattrs. For a preview of my version 3 you can check out my dev tree
here:

Note: that git tree is WIP and may not have all of the attribution and
documentation needed.
