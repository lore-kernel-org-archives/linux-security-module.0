Apologies, somehow I didn't realize that I should have put you too in
CC. It will be fixed at the next iteration.

This is the typical use case I had in mind, although it requires a
conversion.
Ex:

before:

static int a;


void set_a(void)
{
	a = 4;
}



after:

static int *a __ro_after_init;
struct gen_pool *pool;

void init_a(void)
{
	pool = pmalloc_create_pool("pool", 0);
	a = (int *)pmalloc(pool, sizeof(int), GFP_KERNEL);
}

void set_a(void)
{
	*a = 4;
	pmalloc_protect_pool(pool);
}

I'd be interested to have your review of the pmalloc API, if you think
something is missing, once I send out the next revision.
