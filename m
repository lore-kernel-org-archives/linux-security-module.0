Hello David,

Thanks for putting this together. I will let others comment on the
details, but in general, this fully addresses my concern regarding the
unrealistic expectations one might create when printing 'your kernel
is in lockdown mode' into the kernel log without any clarification
what this might mean for your particular system.
