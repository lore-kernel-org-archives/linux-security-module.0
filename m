Ok.

I also agree, but as said if we change stat(), userspace won't be able
to notice if these two proc instances are really separated, the device
ID is the only indication here.

So,

This is reasonable and it follows devpts filesystem, when
'new_instance' was introduced to gradually switch to private
instances, then it was made default behaviour. We can do the same and
improve the situation bit by bit without breaking anything.

I will prepare a new clean version with "newinstance" and
"pids=ptraceable" requiring it, this way we don't change anything that
is related to current 'hidepid' behaviour. Let me know please if you
don't agree.

Thank you for the feedback!
