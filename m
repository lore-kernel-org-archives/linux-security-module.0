The performance of sysv sem and futexes for the contended case is more 
or less identical, it depends on the CONFIG_ options what is faster.

And this is obvious, both primitives must do the same tasks:
sleep:
- lookup a kernel pointer from a user space reference
- acquire a lock, do some housekeeping, unlock and sleep
wakeup:
- lookup a kernel pointer from a user space reference
- acquire a lock, do some housekeeping, especially unlink the to be 
woken up task, unlock and wakeup

The woken up task has nothing to do, it returns immediately to user space.

IIRC for the uncontended case, sysvsem was at ~300 cpu cycles, but that 
number is a few years old, and I don't know what is the impact of spectre.
The futex code is obviously faster.
But I don't know which real-world applications do their own 
optimizations for the uncontended case before using sysvsem.

Thus the only "real" challenge is to minimize cache line trashing.

Bugfixing has always first priority, and a 30% regression in one 
microbenchmark doesn't seem to be that bad.

Thus I would propose that we fix SEMPID first, and _if_ someone notices 
a noticeable regression, then we must improve the code.
