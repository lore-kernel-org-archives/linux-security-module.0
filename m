No.

That may be *one* intention, for some people.

It's not an a-priori one for the actual user.

Again, that has absolutely zero relevance.

Those goals are not the *users* goals.

Be honest now. It wasn't generally users who clamored for it.

If the user actually wanted it, and is asking for it, he can enable
it. Independently of secure boot, which the user generally has little
control over.

That difficulty already exists, the new thing isn't somehow related to
that at all.

Look at our "uyou can only load modules if you're root" rules. Or the
"you can only load modules if they are signed".

See a pattern there? They don't magically enable themselves (or
disable themselves) depending on whether you booted with secure boot
or not.

Yet they are a HELL OF A LOT MORE IMPORTANT than this new patch series.

No. See why it's *NOT* rational, as explained already several times.

Magically changing kernel behavior depending on some subtle and often
unintentional bootup behavior detail is completely idiotic.

It would be idiotic if it was that "check kernel module signatures"
check. This is no less idiotic.

Seriously, listen to your own arguments. If they don't make sense for
checking kernel module signatures, why the hell would they make sense
for something like lockdown.

THE TWO THINGS ARE ENTIRELY INDEPENDENT.

I'm done with you. You're not listening, and you're repeating bogus
arguments that make no sense.

No way in hell will I merge anything like this.
