I'm not committing to dynamic modules, but I am working
to make sure I don't do anything to prevent someone else
from doing it in the future. There are a good number of
people who find the notion of dynamic security policy
disturbing.

I agree that it's better to use a work-around today then to
let the shortcomings of the existing infrastructure stop you
from getting your job done.

It's a whole lot easier to maintain one sort of blob
management then a different kind for each blob. It would
be lots cleaner to have a single call that tells the
infrastructure how much space you need for all your blobs
than a separate interface for each.

So I see.

I think that would be the prudent approach. There is still
the possibility that blob sharing (or full stacking, if you
prefer) won't be accepted any time soon.
