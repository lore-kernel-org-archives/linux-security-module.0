This is my point. Apps will continue to shoot themselves in the foot. Of course
the correct response to one of these vulns is to not pass ttys across a
security boundary. We have an opportunity here to reduce the impact of this bug
class at the kernel level. Rejecting this mitigation because the real solution
is to use a tty/pty pair is like saying we should reject ASLR because the real
solution to buffer overflows is proper bounds checking.

Totally agree. VMs >> Containers but the cat is out of the bag and we can't put
it back.
