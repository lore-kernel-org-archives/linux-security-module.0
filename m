Not strictly. It's just a function declaration.
As long as it is not used, the linker will not complain.
The #ifdef placed around the use and definition is sufficient, from a
correctness perspective.

But it's a different question if there is any standard in linux about
hiding also the declaration.

I am not very fond of #ifdefs, so when I can I try to avoid them.

Because that's the whole point of the function: prove that pmalloc
protection works (see the message in the pr_info one line above).

The function is supposed to do:

* create a pool
* allocate memory from it
* protect it
* try to alter it (and crash)

*i = 0; performs the last step
