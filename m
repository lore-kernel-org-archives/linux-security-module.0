Can't we also have a sysctl that toggles if CAP_SYS_ADMIN is involved in
this whitelist check? Otherwise someone might leave things out of the
whitelist just because they want to use those ioctls as a privileged
process. Also restricting a privileged user from ioctls with this
whitelist approach is going to be pointless because, if the whitelist is
configurable from userspace, they will just be able to modify the
whitelist.

I'm fine with moving this to an LSM that whitelists ioctls. I also want
to understand what a whitelist would like look and how you would
configure it? Does a sysctl that is a list of allowed ioctls work? I
don't want to just have a static whitelist that you can't change without
recompiling your kernel.

just running a sysctl -a on a linux box shows me one thing that looks
like a list: net.core.flow_limit_cpu_bitmap
