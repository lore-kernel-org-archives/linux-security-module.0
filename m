The typical case is when rolling back allocations, on an error path.
For example, with SELinux, the userspace provides the policy, which gets
processed and converted into a policyDB, where every policy maps to
several structures allocated dynamically.

The allocation is not transactional. In case a policy turns out to be
bad/broken, while being interpreted, those structures that were
initially allocated for that policy, must be freed.

Since pmalloc is meant to be a drop in replacement for k/vmalloc, it
needs to provide also pfree.

This is the simplest case, but also the error path must be supported.

All those functions turned out to be necessary when converting SELinux
to pmalloc.
Yes, I haven't published this code yet, but I was hoping to first be
done with pmalloc and then move on to SELinux, which I suspect will be
harder to chew :-/

Because of hardened usercopy [1]:
