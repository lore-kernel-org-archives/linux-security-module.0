Yes, it does work, as Roberto pointed out in a subsequent post. ?For
TPM 2.0 the first digest algorithm in the IMA hash agile crypto
header, will be used as the default digest used for truncating/padding
the other unspecified banks.

In order not to break the existing userspace ABI, we will still need
to support the existing SHA1 based IMA securityfs measurement lists,
whether or not SHA1 is included in the hash agile IMA securityfs
measurement lists.?

Right, tpm2_init_pcr_bank_info(), defined in Roberto's patch "tpm:
introduce tpm_pcr_bank_info structure with digest_size from TPM", gets
the TPM digest size and stores it in the active bank structure
(tpm_pcr_bank_info).
