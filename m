We've done this before and it's a simple enough change in order to be
friendly toward others.

That being said, it's been like this for two years so presumably anyone
who is using this header from C++ is already `extern "C" { ...}' around
their #include.

I'm OK with the patch as-is, but if we run into this issue more often,
we might want to look at doing something kernel-wide.

I'm not sure what though. Adding

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

...

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif

into every uapi file might work.  Unpleasing.
