The reasons why I have doubts about your proposal are:

1) leaving 2/n and 3/n separate mean that the selftest could be broken,
if one does bisections with selftest enabled

2) since I would need to change the selftest, to make it work with the
updated bitmap, it would not really prove that the change is correct.

If there was a selftest that can work without changes, after the bitmap
update, I would definitely agree to introduce it first.

OTOH, as I wrote, the bitmap patch itself is already introducing
verification of the calculated value (from the bitmap) against the
provided value (from the call parameters).

This, unfortunately, cannot be split, because it still relies on the
"find end of the allocation" capability introduced by the very same patch.

Anyway, putting aside concerns about the verification of the correctness
of the patch, I still see point #1 as a problem: breaking bisectability.

Or did I not understand correctly how this works?
