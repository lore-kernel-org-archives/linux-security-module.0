Of course it is.  You just make it a requirement that before an
executable will be signed it will be audited to see that it doesn't
call sys_kexec_load.  Signing presumably means something.  So it should
not be hard to enforce a policy like that on a specialty system call
that most applications will never call.

Signing is only a tool to enforce a policy.  Signing by itself is not a
policy.  Enforcing any quality controls in the signed executables should
trivially prevent kexec_load from being used.
