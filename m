This was the latest post:

	https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/11/9/660

and they were posted multiple times before that, plus distributions, such as
Fedora, have been carrying them for a long while.

It theoretically boils down into those two, but the line is blurrier than you
think.

Further, some of the vectors that can be used to do one can potentially do the
other also and it starts getting to be a lot of extra work to distinguish the
two.

To be able to pass secure boot mode over kexec, you have to make sure that the
kernel image doesn't get corrupted, lest someone blacklist your signing key in
the bootloader.

Yes it should.  If someone can read your kernel image, they can steal the
crypto keys you use to encrypt your filesystem.

Not so for /dev/port.  Read & Write here are _not_ the same as Read & Write
on, say, /dev/mem.  In fact, if /dev/mem gives you access to mmio ports, then
the same applies there.  Btw, Fedora hasn't even provided /dev/kmem for a
while.

Yes - but that's what Alexei Starovoitov specified.  bpf kind of sucks since
it gives you unrestricted access to the kernel.

Yes.  IMO it should be locked down entirely.  However, it's been abused and
there are things in there that are apparently needed (ie. it's not
debugging-only now); unfortunately, it *also* contains files that directly map
hardware.

Good catch, thanks.

> Also, as above, I really dislike this patch.

You dislike everything, but you didn't say so any of the times these patches
were posted...

Perhaps, but at the time I added it, I didn't want to go back and change the
existing patches again.  If I have to do so, I'll fold it in then.
