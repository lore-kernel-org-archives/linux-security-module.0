I've been thinking about this again, so my patches did not convert
creds, inodes etc, I don't have a use case for them now. My use case
was for task->security and I re-used the simple approach. I can't
offer a solution for other blobs since I'm not familiar with their
context nor the different use cases. I checked TOMOYO and that was
easy, but I can't check all of them. I agreed that I may use
rhashtables but as Kees pointed out this may introduce overheads and
extra memory, where the task->security for this ModAutoProtect LSM
will only require an extra sizeof(unsigned long) per-task. Also again
the problem is not in this proposed Module, the problem is in modules
that can't be stacked together.

I am bringing this, since maybe after we manage to merge this, and if
Kees agree I may send another set of patches for Yama to enable the
same per-task context, this enables containers but also allows later
in systemd-logind sessions to set it where all inferiors inside the
user sessions are protected by default, not only some apps or special
desktops but for all. So I will hit the same problem again where to
put it? You said that the code that generalize the blobs isn't that
hard, but also in a previous response that it may not be accepted...
so I will try to converge the task->security blob to be more like the
infrastructure that you are proposing, then resubmit and maybe we will
enable these modules that are stackable by default.

Is this reasonable ?


Thanks!
