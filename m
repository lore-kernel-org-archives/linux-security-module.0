Consideer that if we use CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG now, then any applications
which are currently being given CAP_SYS_ADMIN would need to be updated
with a second capability.  Not acceptable.  Even when we split up
CAP_SYSLOG, we took care to avoid that (by having the original capability
also suffice, so either capability worked).
