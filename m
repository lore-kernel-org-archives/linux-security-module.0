Ok, in the meantime I've made a few updates in my tree which I think
make the code a lot nicer (and do move the conversion to setxattr()),
but there's a bug in that which I'm still trying to nail down.  I'll
send a new version when I get that figured, and we can see how close
to ok that is.

Note that upstream cap_inode_removexattr and cap_inode_setxattr()
upstream still don't respect the fs_user_ns properly either (the
proper code is in the Ubuntu kernel, maybe it's in your -next
tree, I don't know how you and Seth are coordinating that)
