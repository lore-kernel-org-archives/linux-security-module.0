This is actually about genalloc. The genalloc documentation is high
level and mostly about the API, while this talks about the guts of the
library. The part modified by the patch. This text doesn't seem to
belong to the generic genalloc documentation.
I will move it to the .c file, but isn't it too much text in a source file?

ok

I'll put "size in bytes of a chunk of memory"

yes :-(

ok

ok

ok, also for further occurrences
