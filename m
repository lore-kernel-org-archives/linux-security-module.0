No, I am fine with keeping this as a single series. I don't want
anything under drivers/efi to imply policy regarding lockdown. Kernel
lockdown should be a feature that lives somewhere else, and which
contains a CONFIG_ option that implies 'lockdown is enabled by default
when UEFI secure boot is detected.' The code that gets added to
drivers/efi should only concern itself with establishing whether
secure boot is in effect or not (and can hence be enabled
unconditionally)

Yes. As I said, supporting UEFI secure boot (whatever that could mean)
and implementing a lockdown policy when it is enabled are two entirely
different things.

OK.

I *think* that could be useful, although it was meant as an
illustration rather than actual suggestion.

No, not at all. But patch 4/5 contains this line

pr_info("Secure boot enabled and kernel locked down\n");

which I don't like at all, given that nothing is actually locked down.
I have been working in this area long enough to know that people will
interpret 'lockdown' or 'secure' to mean anything they like if it is
left unqualified.

So what I would prefer is to separate this from the EFI code, and
perhaps print something like

lockdown: Kernel lockdown policy in effect due to xxx

and print a subsequent line for every lockdown feature that is enabled, e.g.,

lockdown: disabling MSRs
lockdown: disabling hibernate support

etc etc

These are just examples, of course, but it manages the expectations,
and as a bonus, it makes differences between architectures much more
visible.

OK, and that is fine. I would just like this modest stance to be
reflected in the code and especially the log messages.

No, I think this is a very important feature. But it needs to be more
transparent to avoid a false sense of security.
