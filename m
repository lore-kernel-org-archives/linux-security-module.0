Subject: [PATCH v2] fscrypt: fix dereference of NULL user_key_payload
Message-ID: <20171009194618.67494-1-ebiggers3@gmail.com>
To: linux-security-module@vger.kernel.org
List-Id: linux-security-module.vger.kernel.org

From: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>

When an fscrypt-encrypted file is opened, we request the file's master
key from the keyrings service as a logon key, then access its payload.
However, a revoked key has a NULL payload, and we failed to check for
this.  request_key() *does* skip revoked keys, but there is still a
window where the key can be revoked before we acquire its semaphore.

Fix it by checking for a NULL payload, treating it like a key which was
already revoked at the time it was requested.

Changed since v1: added Reviewed-by and resent as standalone patch.
Can this please be taken through the fscrypt tree?
