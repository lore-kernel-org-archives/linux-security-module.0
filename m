This patch has pre-existed long before any of this post-quantum stuff,
and there are good reasons so to have buffers managed given e.g., 
complexity of tpm2-sessions code. It prevents any major risk for
memory leaks.

Trenchboot extends the use buffers to early boot and we want a robust
structure. I'm not going to spend my time reading about philosophical
aspects of API design. There are quantitative reasons to decrease
the risk of memory leaks.
