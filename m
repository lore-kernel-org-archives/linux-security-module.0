Does this mean that the firmware signature is contained within the
firmware? ?On Linux, is anything verifying this signature? ?Or is this
the hw verifying the firmware's signature?

Ok, but why differentiate between "fixed" and research/development
FPGA functions? ?In both cases, the FPGA firmware would need to be
signed locally. ?Wouldn't this be similar to kernel developers
building their own kernels and signing the kernel modules?
