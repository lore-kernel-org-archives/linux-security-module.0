Right, though in the case of init, it could flip that toggle for
itself and it would then effectively be system-wide.

Okay, I see what you mean here. You want to clearly distinguish
between unprivileged and privileged-only. I'm unconvinced that's going
to change much, as the bulk of the exposed request_module() users are
already expecting to be unprivileged (and that's why they were all
converted to requiring a named prefix).

When doing some of the older module name prefix work, I did consider
introducing a new request_module() API that included the prefix name
as an explicit argument (instead of embedding it in the format
string). We could easily start there, and then have "plain"
request_module() require privs. But we'll still need a way to say
"admin doesn't want unpriv module auto-loading".

Many of these callers are using network interfaces to do this work, so
there isn't as clean a permission model associated with those like
there might be with a filesystem open(). But that doesn't matter (see
below).

This really doesn't address the main concern that is the problem:
whitelisting vs blacklisting. In your example, the dialout group gives
access to specific ttys or serial ports, etc, but an admin may want a
way to make sure the users don't load some buggy line discipline. Now,
that admin could blacklist all those modules one at a time, but new
stuff might get introduced, it doesn't handle other subsystems, etc.

We need to provide a way to whitelist autoloaded modules. The
demonstrated need (to whitelist _no_ modules, addressed by this
series) provides that level of control on a task basis (effectively
making it container-specific).

If the per-task thing stays and the global sysctl goes, that would be
fine by me. That still gives admins a way to control the autoload
behavior, assuming their init knows how to set the flag. The global
sysctl, in my mind, is really more of a way for an admin to do this
after the fact without rebooting, etc. But I don't have a strong
opinion about the global sysctl.
