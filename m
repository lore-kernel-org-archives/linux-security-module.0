With secure boot enabled, we establish a signature chain of trust,
rooted in HW, up to the kernel and then transition from those keys to
a new set of keys builtin the kernel and loaded onto the
builtin_trusted_keys (builtin).

Enabling the secondary_builtin_keys (secondary) allows keys signed by
a key on the builtin keyring to be added to the secondary keyring.
?Any key, signed by a key on either the builtin or secondary keyring,
can be added to the IMA trusted keyring.

The "KEYS: Allow unrestricted boot-time addition of keys to secondary
keyring" patch loads the platform keys directly onto the secondary
keyring, without requiring them to be signed by a key on the builtin
or secondary keyring. ?With this change, any key signed by a platfrom
key on the secondary, can be loaded onto the .ima trusted keyring.

Just because I trust the platform keys prior to booting the kernel,
doesn't mean that I *want* to trust those keys once booted. ?There
are, however, places where we need access to those keys to verify a
signature (eg. kexec kernel image).

Nayna Jain's "certs: define a trusted platform keyring" patch set
introduces a new, separate keyring for these platform keys.
