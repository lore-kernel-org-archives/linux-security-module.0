A few cups of coffee later ...

This seems like a regression from my case.

My case (see the example with the initialized state) is:

static void *pointer_to_pmalloc_memory __ro_after_init;

then, during init:

pointer_to_pmalloc_memory = pmalloc(pool, size);

then init happens

*pointer_to_pmalloc_memory = some_value;

pmalloc_protect_pool(pool9;

and to change the value:

support_variable = some_other_value;

pmalloc_rare_write(pool, pointer_to_pmalloc_memory,
                    &support_variable, size)

But in this case the pmalloc allocation would be assigned to a writable 
variable.

This seems like a regression to me: at this point who cares anymore 
about the pmalloc memory?

Just rewrite the pointer to point to somewhere else that is writable and 
has the desired (from the attacker) value.

It doesn't even require gadgets. pmalloc becomes useless.

Do I still need more coffee?
