No need to introduce unamed union or anything. Just use one of the
existing field for install you can make page->mapping point to the
pmalloc pool structure. Or you can store a unique key value.

I believe there is enough unuse field that for vmalloc pages that
you should find one you can use. Just add some documentation in
mm_types.h so people are aware of alternate use for the field you
are using.
