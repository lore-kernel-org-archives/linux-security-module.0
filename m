LoadPin is upstream.

Minor modules like Yama and LoadPin are constrained by not being
able to use security blobs. That seriously limits the sort of thing
you can do with them. It often makes more sense to get the behavior
in mainline under CONFIG_SOMETHING than to provide a minor LSM in
that case.

Anything that would have to be a major (blob using) module has
a very tough time because you have to displace an existing major
module (SELinux, AppArmor, Smack, TOMOYO) in order to use it.
When we get infrastructure managed security blobs upstream most
of the proposed modules could be used in conjunction with the
existing installed modules. Some would have to wait for the
complete stacking solution, but that's limited to use of networking
facilities.

There's also renewed interest in minor modules being dynamically
loadable, so they can be added on a running system as new and
interesting threats get newer and more interesting mitigations.

We don't make it easy for new modules. Some of that is an
artifact of the infrastructure, and some is based on caution.
