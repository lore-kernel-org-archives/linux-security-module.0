it seems to return garbage also without this patch, but I need to clean
up the code, try it again and possibly come up with a demo patch for
triggering the problem.

I'll investigate it more. However it doesn't seem to be related to the
functionality I need. So I plan to treat it as separate issue and leave
find_vm_area untouched, at least in pmalloc scope.
