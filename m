I'm afraid not.

Yes that is exactly the issue / what it happening here.

My main reason for going with crc32 is that the scanning happens before
the kernel is fully up and running (it happens just before the rest_init()
call in start_kernel() (from init/main.c) I'm open to using the
crypto api, but I was not sure if that is ready for use at that time.

Yes ideally this would not be needed at all and/or use a well defined
interface, but alas we don't live in an ideal world :)
