Checks on namespaces where explicitly requested. I think
these are the most sensible, but I'm willing to be educated.
I was also requested to check on potential issues between containers,
but as there is no kernel concept of containers this is the
best I see we can do.

Would you have a suggested granularity? I could have a
configuration option for each of cgroups, user and pid
namespaces but that's getting to be a lot of knobs to
twist.
